Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?,,,,
I need to get myself away from this place,,,,
"I said, ""Yup"" what a concept",,,,
I could use a little fuel myself,,,,
And we could all use a little change,,,,
"Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming",,,,
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running,,,,
Didn't make sense not to live for fun,,,,
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb,,,,
"So much to do, so much to see",,,,
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?,,,,
You'll never know if you don't go (go!),,,,
You'll never shine if you don't glow,,,,
"Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play",,,,
"Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid",,,,
And all that glitters is gold,,,,
Only shooting stars break the mold,,,,
And all that glitters is gold,,,,
