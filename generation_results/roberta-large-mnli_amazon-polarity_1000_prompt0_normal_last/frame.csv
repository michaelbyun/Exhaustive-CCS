Title: Hmmm
Review: To me this is kind of a 'duh' book. Of course marketing targets our kids, and of course if greatly influences them. Nothing new. But if it opens people's eyes that did not yet realize this, and especially if it changes their attitudes towards children and television/videos...then great-- it should be read.

Title: Review from the Synthesis
Review: The second album from grunge-era supergroup Audioslave plays out more like a boring `90s alt-rock mixtape than anything else. It's sad that a talented band like Rage Against the Machine has to play second fiddle to Chris Cornell's ridiculous growls and Jesus Christ posing. Honestly, it sounds like Tom Morello isn't even trying anymore as he strums his guitar, rewrites his past riffs and dicks around on his diverse collection of effects pedals. These guys have just done it so many times over again, it's now become unwelcome nostalgia. They prove this with the album's first radio-ready single, ""Be Yourself."" C'mon, it sounds like Cornell is taking songwriting lessons from Raffi as he sings ""be yourself is all that you can do."" Sorry, it's not going to work this time around.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net

Title: Fantastic hit for New Years
Review: This is by far one of the best singles of the year. I first heard the it in September and I've been listening to it ever since. The lyrics are very uplifting and in her brilliant style Whitney hits every note crisply and perfectly. The only negative I would say about this version of the single is it doesn't have the longer club mixes on it. The maxi-single has a 12+ minute club version of the Jonathan Peter's mix and the Thunderpuss 2000 mix on it. But even this version is still well worth buying. This is a perfect song to help you celebrate the new millennium this New Years so make it into your millennium theme!

Title: Superb
Review: I needed a book for my vacation this past week, and I picked the perfect one. This book is perfectly written by Dave Eggers and brings the story of Valentino Achak Deng - one of the ""Lost Boys of Sudan."" From seven years old until the recent past you follow his journey from his war torn country to his life in a refugee camp, ultimately ending with his relocation into Atlanta.This book blew me away. The first person account of what it was like for these boys who avoided armies, lions, famine and more to make it across the border of Sudan to Ethiopia and then eventually to Kenya. This book opened my eyes up in many ways to the plight of refugees around the world. Fantastic book. JVD

Title: Breadman Ultimate Plus basket issues
Review: Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection BreadmakerBreadman Ultimate Plus is a good machine; however, after having mine for only two years, the basket broke while making jam. That wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I now have jam all through the inside of my Breadman. The mechanism on which the paddle sits simply came apart in the middle of the jam cycle. Now I have no bread machine. This is disappointing since the machine itself was fine before the basket broke.

Review: We would have a problem applying some of the heavy techniques in this book for our moderately out-of-control kids. I think this is a good book for those with seriously out of control teenagers. However for both the serious and less serious cases, some of the recommendations in the book are just too unrealistic, and a little repetitive.

Title: Tales Have Good Surprise Endings
Review: I ended up liking this DVD because each story have a surprise ending that makes the story satisfying and suspense along the way was worth it. Victoria Principal looks fabulous, for someone not in her 20s or 30s (though I don't know how old she's here), and I had hoped to see some nudity but there wasn't any. But she did pretty good being leading role in each tale.

Title: Refreshing perspective on learning
Review: As a teacher at a private school and a homeschooling mom, this book gave me a refreshing perspective on education and learning - both at a structured school and at home. The philosophy of John Holt was what I have read about from ""unschoolers"". I think it is important to consider whether we are motivating our children to learn or teaching them to spit back what we think is important. This book gave me much food for thought in that area.

Title: Excellent MIddle School World History Resource: Greek Philosophy
Review: ""Wise Guy: The Life and Philosophy of Socrates"" by M.D. Usher is an excellent resource book for middle schoolers taking a world history class. Our standards require students to describe the key figures and major beliefs of HInduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Greek philosophy.... This book simplifies the philosophy of Socrates for our 6th graders. The illustrations by William Bramhall further help the students grasp the information - especially our ELL learners who benefit from the colorful visuals that bring the child right to the agora in ancient Athens where they can see Athenians discussing life's tough topics including , justice, right and wrong, wisdom, courage, beauty, love....""All I know is that I know nothing"" - Socrates

Title: Dribble cup, anyone?
Review: This was pretty disappointing. First of all, it's pretty big around. Not easy to lift with one hand when it's full of ice and water. So I MacGyver'd a handle out of the included nylon strap. Eh, it works. But when I tilt it up to sip from it, it tends to dribble several drops down my shirt, especially when it's full.I bought this Igloo cooler in hopes that the insulation would keep my icewater icy, but it doesn't keep things cool any more than the cheap, single-walled, plastic water-bottle it was meant to replace. At least that thing was taller and thinner, which made it easier to hold onto.The nice thing is that it's big enough around to put handfuls of ice into when the lid's off, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. Otherwise, kinda lame. I expected more from Igloo.

Title: Excellent and Informative!
Review: I just loved it, as this film gives you so much more insight about yoga and where it comes from. Those practising yoga should def. watch ORIGINS OF YOGA. That does not mean that you have to be into the spiritual part about yoga. It's just great to see how the ""true"" Yogis live and where it all began. I can't wait for more films like this. I already saw 'Naked In Ashes' by Paula Fouce and it is outstanding, and I hope that it will be available on DVD soon.

Title: DISSAPOINTED! Maybe mine is expired...
Review: This is my first time ever using this product so I didn't know what to expect. I HATE it!. My hands do not feel anywhere near clean after using it, I can eat a meal, then use this product and my hands STILL smell like food. When I pump the foam into my hand, I have to quickly rub it into my hands before it drips down my wrist or through my fingers; I have to ""catch it"" as it's dripping down my wrist, no time to even put the cap back on. When I rub it in my hands, it feels very slick, like I'm rubbing in water. I've used foam sanitizer before and they were just that, FOAM, not liquid. So I am VERY dissatisfied and I will NEVER buy this again. I wish I had used it prior to purchasing so I would have known how it was suppose to be. And if this IS how it is suppose to be, then I would have never bought it. Unfortunately I have a case (6 bottles) of this crap. And 4 out of the 6 (that I've tried) are watered down drippy foam.

Title: Interesting read
Review: I, too, remember the Bette Davis/Charles Boyer film fondly and was glad to find this novel so many years later. I have to agree with others that the second half of the book lacks the compelling interest of the first; Rachel Field was writing about her own family in the latter, and she would naturally be just as interested in it as she was Henriette's life in Paris. I enjoyed the look at New York in the mid-nineteenth century, but the second half of the book just wasn't as compelling. If it had been, I would have given this one five stars. Still, anyone who enjoys historical fiction laced with a bit of romance (not much romance, and somewhat old-fashioned, but sweet) will find much to appreciate in this book.

Still, anyone who enjoys historical fiction laced with a bit of romance (not much romance, and somewhat old-fashioned, but sweet) will find much to appreciate in this book.

Title: Interesting read
Review: I, too, remember the Bette Davis/Charles Boyer film fondly and was glad to find this novel so many years later. I have to agree with others that the second half of the book lacks the compelling interest of the first; Rachel Field was writing about her own family in the latter, and she would naturally be just as interested in it as she was Henriette's life in Paris. I enjoyed the look at New York in the mid-nineteenth century, but the second half of the book just wasn't as compelling. If it had been, I would have given this one five stars.

Title: Definitely NOT Jerry Butler at his best
Review: Sorry Bradley Briggs, that's definitely not Jerry Butler at his best! It seems by 1980 Jerry Butler lost the sparkle and funk of his 1976 ""Love's on the Menu"" album and the fabulous groove on his joint album with Thelma Houston. Once you experienced these, it's hard to settle for anything less. I am confident in his huge catalogue there are some more pearls like these.I wish I knew them all and they were not out of print...

Title: voice has amazing potential, but lacks maturity
Review: I bought this because I had only heard a snipet of ""Don't know why"" and was captivated by Jones' voice. Unfortunately, once I listened to the CD, there was nothing holding me there. The music is flat and has no lasting holding power. I look forward to future Jones' albums, but this one is going in the bin.

Title: Weird
Review: I bought this book after the author was awarded the Nobel prize this year for his literary work. The book is definitely different... fantasy cannibalism in communist China appears to be the main focus of the book. The translation is hard to follow, and the Kindle edition contained a number of misspelled or omitted words. Overall, I do not think this book is worth an average person's limited ""reading"" time.

Title: I LUV LOTR!
Review: I am a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, Ive watched the movie 20 times (date today, 9/12. I luv legolas!) and the first time I saw it, I thought: this move would make a great game! well, from all the reviews, It's lived up to that. I for one will probably play as legolas, since he can fire arrows about two or three times a second, but with this game, you can't win by pushing the same buttons repeatedly. You need to do combos of hits and different combinations, or the enemy will catch on to what you're doing. Also, don't think that the troll in Balin's toom is the only one in the game. They can pop up anywhere. I mean ANYWHERE. The game developers said that themselves. Just don't turn your back on the screen, and you'll be fine. :D

Title: Out of date and incomplete
Review: Honestly, this book is pretty poorly made in comparison to the later edition called Dark Ages Vampire. The art is sketchy, and lots of the disciplines are too vague. I could rant on endlessly about it in detail, but it would be much easier just to get the 2nd edition. The only thing I found useful (and yes, I have both versions, and every Vampire book ever made by White Wolf including the exotic ones most will never hear about) in this book that the new edition didn't cover is a price list for weapons and armor, using Resource dots.

Title: Excellent.
Review: I strongly recommend this book. It is even-handed in its approach, admitting what we can and cannot know from natural law alone. And you can safely disregard the Publisher's Weekly commentary, particularly the comment regarding utilitarianism, as it IS in fact fairly dealt with (despite not being the primary subject of this book). For a more thorough critique of utilitarianism, see the first part of Love and Responsibility, by Karol Wojtyla.

Review: It was mismanufactured and sat out of square on the sled. Then the degree angle levers were misaligned;you could not tighten them as they struck the sled. I found that the big hole in the sled makes it hard to use when starting cutting a beam. The power is not alot different than my 7 1/4 Bosch circulat saw. You have to be really careful to pry away the cut off as the saw binds and stops.The guard lever needs to be longer as NORMAL fingers cant hold it up when starting the cut.I did not find it all that heavy.

Title: A Real Disappointment
Review: Naked Prey & Hidden Prey marked the beginning of the end of the Lucas Davenport that we all came to know & love. In Broken Prey he's so domesticated he's barely recgonizable and with the exception of Sloan and Ellie all the characters with whom Lucas interacted are missing. Also missing is the insight into the mind of the killer that was so much a part of the other books. Instead of the usual page turner this plot seemed contrived & the identity of the killer was right out of left field. This new Lucas is a mere shadow of his old self and that doesn't bode well for any future Prey books - don't know how he could manage it but I hope Sanford can either bring back to old Lucas or introduces a new character just as interesting to replace him.

Review: We've made it up to ""Q"" and the word this time is ""Quicksilver."" That, and Max, as the Max character is very visible in this book.The plot in this book focuses around Temple getting a major new PR assignment at the New Millennium Hotel. A major exhibition is there featuring valuable Russian treasures, the most major bieng a priceless Czar Alexander scepter. It seems that it's a target for theft, but there are those that have more than theft on their minds.Also featured pretty heavily in this book are Shangri-La and her ""poisonous Siamese cat, Hyacinth. And the plot with Matt Devine is really heating up as well.I agree that some elements of the story are becoming a bit soap-operaish and I really didn't think much of the last book in the series. Still, I found this one a reasonably decent read and so I'll be continuing with the series. ""Cat on a Red Romp"" maybe? :)

Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book, the reader is tossed into confusion. The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as critic's recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt.

Title: Crappy Heroine
Review: Gypsy Lover has a romantic sexy hero. Unfortunately, the heroine is predjudiced against gypsies - even after the hero has rocked her world three times! Until almost the last 1/3 of the book, she thinks that Dante is beneath her and can't marry him. But that doesn't stop her from getting it on with him. The sex scenes were pretty hot, too bad it wasn't with another female. I would not bother to buy this book - check it out at the library. A better book from Connie Mason is the Rogue and the Hellion.

Title: Great Theory Poorly Described and Lacking
Review: The concept of UML is a great one and while the authors are great, the book is not. Like the Strousoup C++ it stinks. Just because they developed the idea doesn't mean they can write. The books reads like an Academic book. They try to counteract this with a catchy example at the beginning of each chapter, but fail to explain UML detail in any breadth. At the end of the book I am left feeling like UML is great, but I'm tired, frustrated, and am not quite clear how to use it in any applications -- only that I should.

Title: Duraline is not Duable
Review: I'm looking for an alternative this Homelite DuraLine trim line. These never seem to last very long. I only spend about 8 minutes trimming around stone walls, a concrete patio and wire mesh fence. Although I try to keep the line off the stone and concrete, this line only lasts for 2 trimmings before gets pretty worn down and breaks. It always breaks off before it wears all the way down. Am I expecting too much?

Title: Best Pan I Own!
Review: I love this pan! It is the best pan I've ever owned. My other pans are stainless steel but can't hold a candle to this one. It makes the best omelets and is the best nonstick pan. Just make sure your pan is well heated before cooking and follow the care instructions. You will have no problem. Before I bought this pan I really didn't know anything about them. I didn't know a seasoned pan from an unseasoned pan. There is no need to season this pan as I have read many people do. It works great just as it is right out the box. For those of you who are contemplating buying this pan, just buy it and I guarantee you'll love it!

Title: Its real but OLD..
Review: I believe the fragrance you purchase from Amazon or other outside companies are genuine. The only real concern is the shelf life. I have a friend who works for Macy's and she was explaining to me that many of those colognes, perfumes or scents are outdated or aged really well. So you might end up with a bottle or batch that was produced in 2005 and its on sale now in the year 2012. Cologne life span is usually 3 to 5 years. Many last longer depending on what the make up is.

Title: Ideological theory of history -- and extremely repetitious
Review: Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war. With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance. Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism. He should be writing political speeches, not history. His theories are just plain silly.If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting.

Title: History and love: great combination
Review: Amin Maalouf did a very fine job in the formation of this novel, when combining the fiction with the hisctorical realities. This novel tells about a great love of Omar Khayyam, and concludes with the titanic accident. A great historical persfective, huh?It also includes some rubai's of Omar Khayyam, in which he opposes the GOD's nature, and GOD's laws, which I found to be really great...I strongly recommend this book, to learn something about Omar Khayyam, a small and msyterious history of the middle east, and to have a great time... The only bad thing is you will finish reading it not more than one night, not beacuse it is short but you can not stop reading it...

Title: Could be better... much better...
Review: Now, don't take offence here, but this album did nothing for me. The songs all sounded more or less alike; the band didn't branch out into other styles of singing. Also, truth be told, they do sound like girls. I'm not saying this to insult them. It's just the way it is. The album was full of meaningless pop songs - I doubt if Dream Street actually wrote their own songs (don't hold me to that, though). One thing I will give them though: I've read that all or most of them had Broadway backgrounds before they started singing in a band. So, hey, at least they really can sing. All in all, Dream Street is just another boy band with catchy songs that are bound to get stuck in your head. However, I think pre-teens who are just getting into the music scene might enjoy this CD and will also like the band members, who are still in high school. Otherwise, I'd advise you to look elsewhere for good music.

Title: Disappointing at Best
Review: In conducting my own sociological research and as a former female Marine, I eagerly sought out this book, hoping for real information about the current status and experiences of women in the U.S. military. What I found, however, was 370 pages of self-serving diary-type brooding, anecdotal ""evidence"" of rampant sexual predation by military males, and almost NO voices of the military women themselves. This book is disappointing at best. I found myself appalled by many things Ms. Solaro asserted and alternately laughing at other things that were simply preposterous. I suppose this book could be useful to give someone an extremely subjective view of women in the contemporary military; however, readers BEWARE that this is written by a journalist! Although, Ms. Solaro alludes to her credentialed education, I see very little evidence of an acceptable methodology nor support for her extrapolated conclusions. Readers should take this book with a heavy dose of skepticism.

I would recomend this album to anyone who: 1) Is having problems with their life right now because he talks a lot about his life problems.2) Anyone who likes eminem because he is probally the best singer/songwriter i have ever heard3) Anyone who wants a change in their music and hasen't heard eminem yet.

Title: Excellent Light Stand
Review: This stand is a very study stand that can take a lot of use and abuse. I use it inside and outside. The only slight down side is the overall length of the stand when it is collapsed for transport. I have a 42"" bag and it will not fit so I have to buy a longer bag if I want to transport it with my other equipment or just carry it separately which is not really a big deal. I would recommend this stand if you need the extra height.

Title: A fresh understanding of Matthew's text
Review: Prof. Neyrey brings fresh insight to the text of Matthew using resources from otherwise ignored classical sources. With the tools of classical literature and social science criticism, Neyrey writes clearly, arguing cogently for Matthew as encomium literature. A must for every bookshelf.

Title: A Fun Reference
Review: I bought this book because of the sibling name relationships the book offers. It lists possible sibling names for the names it defines, and it groups the names into classes and trends. It's a fun book to simply look up names in---it got 3 of my husband's sibling's names! I was pleased at how good her research was, and although I didn't intend to use it to name a child (more as a research tool for my students to use in a classroom project), I have loaned it to 2 separate families to help them with their own baby naming strategy. I highly recommend the book!

Title: Deserves a Couple of Negative Stars
Review: Look somewhere else for your strategy fix. I was desperate for something new and bought this game, even though I couldn't find any reviews of it. My money was wasted.So much is so very wrong with this game. For brevity I'll give one example: for your global empire, running in realtime, you have a jump-map of the world about the size of your thumbprint. You hear that there is an attack on, say Montreal, and you have to pick a point in the NW North America, about the size of the head of a thumbtack, click then hunt around for the frickin city you need to find. Then you have to jump to southern Europe and hunt for another city. It is exhausting and stupid - like many other features of this game.

Review: My husband ordered these batteries for me in December. I can not believe how poor the quality is. The batteries are either dead on arrival or only last 1-4 hrs. I did have a few that lasted 6 hrs. The exp date is Aug 2016. I have already gone through a box of 60 batteries and am on my second box. When I got my hearing aids in May, I bought a box of Rayovacs. Each battery lasted 3-4 days. Save your money and frustration and do not order iCell Tech 312 batteries. The only use for these batteries are the trash.

Title: Don't fit like 511's
Review: Like other (negative) reviews, the jean color in the picture was different than what I received. The picture of the chain link color shows a blue pair of jeans but I received a gray pair. However, the label on the jeans do say chain link. I ordered a 28x30, like all my other Levi's 511 skinny pants but these didnt fit like them. They fit more like very skinny jeans, like the kind on the Miller Lite commercial. The waist size was correct and did fit like 28 should. Levi's is at fault for not keeping the all sizes at a standard. I will be returning them.

Title: Already spellbound by this brilliant book
Review: I'm only halfway through this magnificent new novel from Jennifer Egan and I am so spellbound that I'm rationing my reading of it now. Twenty pages a day, no more. Well, except if there's a chapter that's almost done. Or if it's raining.What Egan has done is made the telling of the story almost as suspenseful as the plot. The succession of voices has its own mysterious chemistry as this tale of two cousins-bound by a shocking childhood betrayal- unfolds in a mythically mysterious setting somewhere in eastern europe.I don't want to 'tell' the plot for fear of spoiling it, but in fact, any competent telling would be as long as the book and I don't think this one is susceptible to spoilage. A simply brilliant book.Lynn Hoffmanauthor of bang-BANG forthcoming from Kunati andThe New Short Course in Wine from Prentice Hall.

Title: Cyberpunk in a Society of Women
Review: Slow River"" is good. I particularly enjoyed the author's ability to turn a phrase. However, the story lacked ""closure"".In the story a young heiress is kidnapped and escapes into a cyberpunk netherworld. Here she hides-out looking to find herself.The tech is good, the prose is good, and the setting was noir and gritty. However, the story is a bit thin when it comes to Lore's family which features so prominently in the beginning and end. Lore's mother, and sisters are cyphers that come to figure too largely in the story.Finally, where did all the men and straight-het sex go? The novel seemed to exist in a society of women. The absence of male characters (except as evil doers) was a bit too obvious. This detracted from the reality of the story.By the way, I think the ""River"" is the Humber.

Good concepts, but not enough for a book..... and not so different than what others have proposed in other books. Just a different take. Would have made a nice pamphlet.

Title: too much talking; not enough instruction
Review: I purchased this video hoping it would help me with my coaching of two youth league teams. One 10-11 year olds; the other 12-13 year olds. I've been coaching several years with good success and thought Mr. Wooden's video would heighten my knowledge of the game and game preparation. Frankly, I am dissapointed at the long-on-talk short-on-skills development contained in it. Mr. Wooden goes on for long sections discussing tiresome aspects of the game...and the excessive length makes it useless for kids. It strains my attention span. The drills are one or two-on one; if I do these drills, I have eight other kids standing around bored. Good man, dated video style. p.s. The coach of Duke University (Mike K) has an excellent vido out for teaching kids although I can't find it on Amazon and someone borrowed mine. Help if you know how I can get it.

Unfortunately, my expectations were set based on the local library having Levine's 4th edition. As an example, compare the jack knife sections and the descriptions on patterns. I assumed this book would be an update on values, but leave content intact. Instead, big chunks are missing. Blade is a fine magazine, but this book is a big disappointment.

Title: Great cast bogged down in sub &#65533;B&#65533; material.
Review: How can a movie with this cast, and directed by Barry Levinson, be so bad? I've never really listen to profession critics, so I rented this expecting a pretty good film. Boy, was I ever wrong. This film miss-fires on every level. I thought I was watching a 50s `B' film, and basically, I was.

Title: Great cast bogged down in sub &#65533;B&#65533; material.
Review: How can a movie with this cast, and directed by Barry Levinson, be so bad? I've never really listen to profession critics, so I rented this expecting a pretty good film. Boy, was I ever wrong. This film miss-fires on every level. I thought I was watching a 50s `B' film, and basically, I was.

Title: Darth Maul Lightsaber
Review: This is a great lightsaber but just a few exeptions, first off when your doing some tricks and the lightsaber's ""Ignite"" button usually hits your fingers and it turns it off.Second the length of the blades for WAY too short and that makes it unreal but other than that its a great toy and fun to play with.

Title: A Great Mix of New Material From Dwight Yoakam
Review: I can't think of a past CD that I have purchased where I have loved all the tracts contained in it as I do in this one. This CD ranges from emotional ballads to upbeat, fastly-paced songs. The vocals are excellent while delivering the lyrics, sometimes keeping one in suspense with a changing tempo. The instrumental portion and background vocals fit in perfectly. It's definitely my favorite.

Title: LP or CD...a no-brainer choice!
Review: I first purchased this on CD and liked the songs despite the tinny sound quality. Yesterday I bought the LP in a used store and the difference is immediately clear. Frank Beard's drums are actual drums vice whatever they put on the CD. Now I know why that 1976 tour was THE SHOW to see back then. Easily one of their best albums and it should be heard on vinyl. Now, go get your LP!

Title: Very Disappointed
Review: Do.Not.Purchase. The plush cat bus that they send you looks nothing like the picture. It was terrible to think that they were charging about 20-something dollars for such a piece of trash.All the legs were simply a single piece of fabric with cotton shoved in at random intervals- making sudo legs that were fused together.The sewing was absolutely terrible- you can see places where the machine/person missed with cotton poking out of the plushThe dimensions were very misleading- while the description claims it is 7 inches long- it doesn't mention that it is about 3 inches tall.I have ordered both the catbus and gray totoro from this company- completely ripped off both times. If you want a good quality plush, shop from a Japanese website instead.

Title: Disappointment
Review: Not being aware that Mr. Ludlum had passed away, I eagerly purchased this book. What a disappointment! It's a shame to carry on his name in this fashion.In my opinion, the book was quite amateurish, slow and wordy for wordiness' sake (case in point - the meeting in the airport with the guy using (too many!) fractured idioms, e.g., ""kill two fowl with one rock"", ""birds of the same plumage seek out one another's company"", ""all that coruscates (coruscates???) is not gold."") Also, as someone else mentioned, the editing seemed lacking (the gun that was seen beneath a bush, highly accessible, then later is was ""completely inaccessible"").I won't make the mistake again - there are much better choices around.

Review: Um... is it just me or did this storyline borrow HEAVILY from John Boorman's 1975 Zardoz starring Sean Connery in one of his early post-Bond movies? Similarities:* Isolated outpost created by scientists that is protected from ""nature""* People who live forever who are having mental issues (recycled clones in Flux)* Sterility issues in the population* A scientist manipulating the actions of an individual with a talent for extreme violence in an effort to take down the status quo (the old guy in the blimp thingy. In Zardoz it was a scientist in a flying stone idol (that looks remarkably like Janus) trying to find just the right guy (Connery - ""Seth"" if I recall correctly) among a bunch of savages to do the deed.I mean, it isn't an out and out rip off, but the story certainly seems to borrow heavily from Zardoz - also a very weird film that seems to lack cohesion.

Title: Deep in the Heart of the Beast
Review: I'm rereading Heart of the Beast because I tore through it too fast the first time to savor it fully. Told in first person, it's the story of hard-headed, vulnerable Iris Steele who's trying to run the family wheat farm/cattle ranch in Eastern Oregon and struggling against a natural world as ruthless as her kinfolk.The land itself is a major character, cherished and fought over for four generations. As Iris discovers how they got the land from the Nez Perce, who are suing her to get it back, her struggles to save it illuminate her understanding of her father, violent, driven Ike Steele, and her own nature.In a series of dramatic, wonderfully detailed scenes we are Iris delivering a calf, caught in a wildfire, connecting with her long-yearned-for lover, trying in a little twin-engine plane to rescue a wounded Indian on a reservation with no landing strip.This novel is one of those rare total immersion experiences. Not to be missed.

Title: great resource
Review: This manual is an EXCELLENT resource for APA style. I'm a grad student was having trouble with term papers and APA format. It seemed like every website I checked had a different rule. This manual is recent, up-to-date, easy to use and relatively easy to understand (as easy as understanding APA could be). The table of contents and index are both very helpful in navigating through the manual. I highly recommend this spiral bound version, as it is good for staying open where you need it, especially when your hands are busy doing other things (like typing away at term papers). It is also a good resource for journal article/technical writing in general. It would be nice if it came with external tabs (even internal ones would be great), but it's not too hard to add your own.

Title: Keep It Up, Tim!
Review: I love this cd! I have been listening to it steady since I bought it the other day. I feel this CD represents a lot of maturity in his singing. The ballads ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" and ""Please Remember Me"" are absolutely wonderful!

Review: These decals look great when you first put them on the tire. I bought 3 and after a few months two have fallen off during normal driving. Possibly try super gluing these to your wheel? I don't feel like these are worth the $11 I paid.

Review: It doesn't do anything that's promised in the description. Couldn't even handle cut dried apricots, that's been sitting in water for 2 hours (can you imagine how soft were they?)It says that it can turn chunky fruits, frozen ingredients and even ice into the smoothest purees, creamiest healthy fruit beverages and more ..goodluck with that!

Title: I witnessed this concert live
Review: On March 29, 1959, I had my 15th birthday & as one of my presents my great-aunt took me to this concert. I was overawed by the presence of one of my favorite opera singers. This CD captures the true essence of that performance. It is great to relive one of the most vivid events in your life. The sound is very clean & realistic. The concert was partially sponsored by Steinway & Sons and state of the art recording techniques were employed. This recording is a good representation of what he really sounded like. It is truly an historic recording and should be purchased by anyone who loves Björling. He died about a year and a half later.

Title: O.K. version
Review: I have read the Lombardo translation of the Iliad and its very well done, except he is in a league of giants; I think for the lyical aspect of Homer Pope is the best, and for the symplicity of the Epic, Lattimore and Fagels do a great job. I think if somebody want to enjoy the Iliad, Lombardo is a terrific starting point, but the others should not be forgoten. (Esp Pope: he is my favorite, I am VERY partial).

Review: I am extremely dissapointed in these earbuds. I received them in late January and they were not working properly by early March.

Title: realistic, gut-wrenching, tight story with plenty of action
Review: I picked up Keeper out of curiosity and was hooked from the first chapter. It read quickly, but not for lack of substance. The plot was put together well, leaving you guessing right up to the end. The characters, especially Kodiak, were not unbelievable supermen, and were susceptable to pain and anguish. Rucka's story of a young man doing an ugly job was a great one, and a great debut. It wasn't just a mystery/suspense story. It also handled an extremely sensitive issue with the professionalism of a seasoned author. I applaude him for that and rank him right up there with Robert Parker and Ross Macdonald. I am anxiously awaiting his next book, Finder, and hope for many more Atticus Kodiak novels

His descriptions of street life in LA are appaling and force the reader to take a look at their own views of gangs and their members. While some of his descriptions of gang activities can be disturbing, there are effective in showing what it really means to be a gang member in LA.

Title: Didn't Sway Me
Review: Obviously this film was made to make people feel sympathy for the subjects. It was interesting to watch, but I don't feel any pity for these men. They were rescued by the US, given a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a great life, and they all just pissed it away. They admit that they never bothered becoming citizens. It just wasn't important to them. They break our laws, and then they are outraged when they are booted. If only we can exile all our criminals! One of them was especially obnoxious: Kim Ho Ma, a shiftless, wannabe gangsta. After being deported, he was lucky enough to land in a halfway house that gave him free room and board. All he did there was smoke, listen to rap, and play cards. How about helping out the old man mopping the floor at the very least? I could only roll my eyes as he preened and complained that he didn't fit in because he was raised in America. At the very end, all he had to say was F this and F that and F America. Good riddance.

Too bad Tea's first major dancehall blowout, the classic ""Searching in the Hills,"" wasn't somehow put on this lp (maybe it will on a re-issue at some point), but no matter.This lp is a dancehall legend, and asserted Cocoa Tea into the pantheon of greats, where he still resides.

NOW LOOK, If you listen to music on a regular stereo or regular $20 headphones you WILL NOT notice a difference- just go out and buy this album and DROOL. But if you are an audiophile like myself, with a truly hi fidelity stereo or great headphones (sennheiser or grado or etymotic) then this record is gonna make you sad.

Review: First I'd like to thank prodigy for making one of the most memorable and addictive albums of all time.However, the sound quality on this record is bad. NOW LOOK, If you listen to music on a regular stereo or regular $20 headphones you WILL NOT notice a difference- just go out and buy this album and DROOL. But if you are an audiophile like myself, with a truly hi fidelity stereo or great headphones (sennheiser or grado or etymotic) then this record is gonna make you sad. With SUCH potential it's a shame they didn't record this better.Oh well.p.s. SATANSATANSATAN

Title: Weak compared to previous Best Of sets
Review: There isn't much to say beyond that this set advertises over 30 full fights but that is simply untrue. On previous sets there were full fights that played as part of the feature montage in addition to several full bonus fights. I believe 2010 had 40+ full fights while this set only has around 5 full fights. It's a disappointing highlight reel from the year and many of the highlights aren't that great. I was upset with this compilation.

Title: Hardly the best Fleming!
Review: I do not understand why this disc chooses to record the 'remote' Mozart arias, No. 1.Ms. Fleming failed to impress listeners as a Mozartian in this disc, No. 2.A singer of her reputation should be more discerning in her discography.Not that the rarer or earlier Mozart is any less good than Cosi fan tutte or Don Giovanni.But if you have listened to recordings of all Mozart's earlier opera (to which I have), you would be bound to admit that Ms. Fleming did not fare well in those pieces she had chosen here. And even in her Donna Elvira on this disc, she is not in best form.Mozart is not an easy composer to handle. The timbre of Fleming does not sit well in the repertoire chosen here.

Review: Reading is, for me, instructive, uplifting, entertaining, or enlightening. To be dark without any of the other attributes feels like a waste of time. This book wasted my time.

Title: If You Like Elevator Music, You'll Like This CD
Review: The first Kenny Rankin CD I bought was ""Because of You,"" a spare, jazzy CD from the early 90s. Loved it. This CD from 1980 is nothing like it, though. Producer Don Costa did Kenny a disservice by pouring syrupy ""elevator music"" arrangements on top of Kenny's voice. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this CD, and ""The Kenny Rankin Album"" (another Don Costa production). I'm going to try again with Kenny, but I'll stick to his later stuff and his ""live"" stuff. He's best when it's just him and his guitar or piano--he's great, he doesn't need any ""help.""

Title: Bartok's Gothic Opera
Review: While I cannot repeat what the other review states, I can only say that he seems to be wrong about Samuel Ramey being Hungarian. Soprano Eva Marton is Hungarian and is doing a marvelous job as the newest victim of the devilish Bluebeard. The story is dark and symbolic. Bluebeard (not Bluebeard the Pirate) is a wealthy property owner who lives in a foreboding castle. He has just married wife No. 3. He warns her not to wander to a certain part of the castle. Naturally, curiosity gets the best of her and she searches the forbidden area despite his orders. What she finds there reveals a darker side to her husband. Eva Marton has a huge voice that fully captures every nunance of this character. Ramey has a terrific voice with all the right earthy and devilish tone for the part. Adam Fischer conducts Hungarian forces in Bartok's great work of Gothic and surreal drama.

Review: When I first heard the hit I was amazed at what great work went into this piece. I was hooked at first sound to it. I was also suprised to hear that it is an Italian group that did it. I had never heard of an Italian group like this. Very good! Keep up the good work. By-the-way, Blue is my favourite colour.

Title: Not happy...
Review: I bought this charm for myself cause it's my birthstone but when I recieved it I was not happy with the way it is made. It doesn't sit flat on your chest, no matter what chain you put it on. It's very small and I don't think the color is very good. I NEVER wear it!

Title: Incorrect parts in package
Review: I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.

Title: 90 minutes of your life you won't get back
Review: I never write a product review but I wanted to write one to warn others about this movie. Everything you need to know about this is in the trailer. The nun on the front is actually a passerby in a scene and nothing to do with the film at all. If you want to see a really poor exorcist meets blair witch then this is for you. I regret watching this as my neither my wife nor myself enjoyed it despite the beautiful italian architecture that it doesn't even appreciate.

Title: Not sure who will benefit from this
Review: Honestly, I was surprised to see that most of the reviews posted for this book have been positive. Although the book does contain some useful information, the vast majority of it seems to be little more than filler. John Hattan's review really sums it up much better than I can, so suffice it to say that if you're looking at this as a possible guide to help you create game art, you're likely to be disappointed, unless you're interested in the (very general) theory behind it. For every book I review, I try to be as fair as possible and at the very least state what kinds of people would enjoy the book, but I'm unable to do so in this case. Since (based on the reviews) there are at least a few people out there who might enjoy this, the best I can suggest is to read the TOC, or even better, browse the book at your local bookstore, before deciding whether or not to buy this book.

Title: Connectivity for your Handspring at a very competitive price
Review: The Handspring modem is one of the middle class modems on the market, and Amazon is offering at a great price! If you want to connect to the internet on your handspring at a good price, then this is your best bet. Although it may not be the fastest OR the thinnest in its class, it functions very well. Besides, on a tiny screen with limited content, you don't need to have a 56k modem for the connection to be fast. And, if you don't mind, carrying around an extra half-inch on your palm isn't that bad. You would be amazed with what you can do with a palm pilot hooked up to the internet. On the go, I often synchronize avant-go, connect to AOL anywhere, and browse the web all in the palm of my hand. So, if you want to be truly ""connected"" then buy this modem while they last.

Review: The game play is fun, but the graphics are a bit off. Too grainy (I have a 57 inch Sony Hi-Scan tv. Using monster gamelink composite PS2 cables, so its not the tv) Maybe I'm spoiled with the PC version of GTA 3 which is far superior graphically. I just rented this game and I think I'll hold off purchasing until they come out with the PC version. Hopefully soon

Title: Very happy with Extendatrunk in 2006 Wrangler
Review: All good. East to install and great fit and looks. Largest storage space. Three issues with instructions:1. They say to partially tighten the five bolts that hold the unit together but do not say when to tighten them. Turns out they can be fully tightened and the cover plate put on before ever putting the trunk into a 2006 Wrangler.2. The gap between the sliding top and the jeep door when the jeep soft top retaining bar is removed was not described. Some method should be included to resolve that gap by limiting the trunk top from sliding too far forward. However this is not a big deal.3. There were no instructions on using the ""tool"" to insert and compress the jeep side attachment points.

Title: A must read
Review: Loosely based on the Children of Lir legend of Gaelic folklore, this book was astounding. Sorcha is a heronie who finds herself in a situation that would test the strongest and find them lacking. She discovers within herself a strength unknown and a resolve that could lose her the one she is destined to be with. She comes to the discovery that while blood binds, love strikes like lightning. You will say to yourself 'how beautiful' when you finally put it down [this is one you can't put down until you finish]. Ms Marillier has burst onto the Fantasy genre with pens blazing, and a skill to capture the reader that I rarely find.

Review: Just what I needed, will easily fit in a backpack, light, and fills the tires fairly quickly. Literally the only negative is the lack of gauge, but you can get by on feel of the tire alone, so not a critical issue.

Title: Nady WA-120LT/E does not perform well
Review: Bought system with lavalier mic and it did not pick up very well at all. Had to hold mic in front of my mouth, so what is the value of a lavalier mic. Ordered a headset mic at extra cost. This mic did pick up to some extent, but had a very hard time positioning the Portable system so that the signal picked up. Standing across the room in front of system did work ?OK?. Tried to use in a small room presentation, but eventually shut it down and spoke without the system.

Title: Amazing...while it works.
Review: Like most people who ordered this bottle my initial few uses were great. Keeps things cold and does not leak no matter what with a tough rubberized bottom. In less than a month however, the interior gasket is gone and now it leaks like a sieve. First of all where did the seal go? Did it just fall out during washing or did it fall apart and I ended up swallowing it? (Not a fun thought) I was very careful while washing and did it by hand watching the whole time so I am doubtful that it just fell out, but I guess it's possible.All in all it's a great product with a crippling design fault that makes it utterly unusable for it's intended purpose that costs more than bottles that do the same thing. How can I give it more than a single star?Edit: Going to attempt a return for a refund. I don't feel like being paranoid about the seal and wondering if it's going to fail when I have it in a backpack or somewhere else where if it started leaking again it would really suck.

Title: Finally, Something Works as Advertised
Review: I have not had any cooling problems. I invested in this unit to hopefully keep it that way. It works exactly the way it should. It is not horribly loud. You can hear the fans but there are five extra fans, so you will hear them running. The noise is not obnoxiously loud.For those of you who have had troubles with the fans not shutting down after use, I feel for you and hope you can either have the unit repaired or replaced. My unit shuts down after the PS3 has be shutdown for 40-minutes...and that is after I have played games for more than 8-hours. I know, I am a game junkie :)Have a great Holiday!Smacka

Title: No lies here.
Review: I saw Dakota Skye last year at the Phoenix Film Festival and have been anxiously awaiting its release on DVD ever since. This is one of those rare movies that you really want to share with your close friends, but you find it impossible to sum up. ""A girl who can see through any lie falls in love with boyfriend's best friend..."" sounds simple, right? Doesn't come close to doing this movie justice. This film works its way inside and takes you on an emotional journey right along with the characters. Dakota's first line hooked me and something about that character pulled me all the way through to the end. Viewers will want to compare this to Juno, but as much as I enjoyed that film, Dakota Skye has a unique spark beyond comparison. Excellent direction and fantastic acting all around. This movie comes with my highest recommendation!

Title: Eno's take on minimalism
Review: I didn't know what to expect with this cd. Eno tries everything! I have always loved his catchy hooks, infectious rhythms and thought-provoking (or mind-numbing) lyrics.This cd is not ambient music, and it is not some form of heady satirical/lyrical rock. What it comes closest to is his take on minimalism, as apparently repetitive patterns are laid out, but slowly transform in different ways (not so repetitive after all!). It isn't dance music exactly, since it isn't that intense -- but it isn't entirely vacuous either. In my opinion, it's a welcome in-between: music to drift in and out of, while doing something else. I can sink into it at moments, or let it go on without me. It sparks my imagination without dominating my thoughts, and that's just what I was hoping for when I bought it.

Title: This translation served my needs
Review: While I have a number of translations of Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" I wanted a newer one which would be easier to read in more or less modern English. This one suited my needs now.Ciardi is a poet rather than a Dante scholar, and his translation reflects that approach, but I found it very useful, especially with the extensive introductions and notes he provides. I would recommend this work to anyone who is new to Dante's contribution to Western literature.

Title: So Far, So Good...
Review: I've owned mine for about a year, my first ever BT headset, purchased at a local RadShack for $50 - the only complaints that I have is that:A) when I'm not talking on it, the headset loses contact with my motorola phone and then usually pops right back in again. or not. depending. sometimes it works right away.. or not. damnit... :DAnd that:B) the MIC sensitivity is cranked way down with no adjustability (this is noise control?).It IS sensitive to proximity with both phone and LT, up to about 30-40' in line of sight, walls not degrading that is... Not bad for BT, according to specs... The battery life still lasts 2-3 hours on a short charge, tho I suspect that will soon degrade, but I have used this headset extensively, daily. Overall, I've been happy with it, and feel that I got my money's worth, but the rest of these horror stories??? Whew! I'll prolly buy something a bit lighter next time, too. peace y'all...

Title: Great to Help you remember Old Testament History.
Review: This is one of the best Old testaments movies I have seen yet and I have seen many. It is true to the Bible and very exciting.Old Testament history is hard to keep straight as so very much happens but this film will burn this time of Saul and David and his son Solomon in your mind and heart not to be forgotten.The acting is wonderful and everything looks real life, like you are there with them.There is of course a lot of killing. It may be too much for small children. Although David sins he still remains a man after God's own heart. God has mercy on him many times. He had to pay dearly for his sins. All that God foretold comes true.A must of all lovers of Old Testament history.

Title: WAY TOO MUCH SEX - and not enough real plot
Review: I have read and loved all of Laurell Hamilton's books - until this one. At least in the other books there was more than just sex going on and you could skip the sex parts and not feel cheated out of your money. If you tried to skip the sex parts in this book, you may wind up with about 20 pages of readable material ( and most of the real plot was rushed). I really hope her next Anita Blake novel is better and that her next Merry Gentry novel does not have the same problem as Incubus Dreams.

Title: A bible without religion
Review: I am a metaphysical pragmatist. I am a Buddhist. Buddhist precepts were written 2500 years ago. So the language and approach to spirit is a bit dated to say the least. A Course In Miracles (ACIM) is the equivalent to an update on spirituality. It was not a ""Life Altering"" experience for me. That happened in 1980 when I was 31. That's when I decided to follow the teachings of The Buddha. ACIM is a reinforcement of my Buddhist practice laid out in Christian terminology. Even though it speaks in Christian terms its teachings are spiritually non-denominational. It is a textbook on what it is to be human. It is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it to all of you on your spiritual path. Peace and Love

Title: Too basic to be useful
Review: The author covers a variety of subjects but too lightly to be useful. Too much effort is spent on things that are useless. For example, Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book's title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design. Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with. Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques. Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all. Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that's available in Windows format free on the internet now. Horn designs are not covered and the project section only has a couple of basic designs. That said, the author does a great job telling you how to make inductors for cross-over networks.I was done with this 200 page book in about 1 hour. Rather dissapointing.

For example, Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book's title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design. Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with. Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques. Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all. Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that's available in Windows format free on the internet now. Horn designs are not covered and the project section only has a couple of basic designs. That said, the author does a great job telling you how to make inductors for cross-over networks.I was done with this 200 page book in about 1 hour. Rather dissapointing.

Title: Broken after 10-month usage
Review: I bought this product last July to ground food for my infant son. It's already broken last month after less a year of usage. The motor stopped working completely. I'm shocked at the low quality of this product. I'll not recommend buying it if you are looking for something more durable.

Title: Bagel holder, not so good!
Review: This bagel holder just slides on the counter as I am trying to slice it and of course not all bagels fit in it. It is hard to get the thing spread apart in order to cut through the opening in the middle. I went back to just cutting the bagles on the cutting board. Not worth your hard earned money.

Title: Fun romance featuring two strong willed characters.
Review: I don't read many romances, but I liked ""Silver Moon Song"" (the book that follows this one in the series) so much that I had to come back and read this one. I was extremely glad that I did. Maggie and Cade's relationship is very complicated and passionate. These characters are well developed and very sympathetic to the reader. Ms. Dellin also writes some pretty good sex scenes here as well. I'm now anxiously awaiting the third installment in this series, which will feature Cade's sister Cotannah

Review: I am very pleased with this set. These bits cut cleanly and do not burn your workpiece. The finished edge is very smooth.

Title: Overlooked, but still a little gem
Review: Everyone knows about Astley's skill as a producer, but his personal music went largely overlooked. I heard ""Jane's getting serious"" on alternative rock stations, and it had a bit of airplay, but the rest of the album went ignored. Big mistake. He writes modestly intelligent rock, and has a way with a catchy bit of rhythm guitar and keyboards. The beats are always just a bit different than what you would expect, and are very hypnotic. Worth a listen... There are a few cuts that are marginal, but ""Jane"", and ""Target Practise"" and ""Better Never than Late"" are good tunes. ""Jane"" is particularly good, and deserved the airplay it got.

Title: Dr. Phil to the Rescue!
Review: He has some very interesting ideas, methods and approaches and the book is easy and interesting to read. In fact, Dr. Phil would ""turn therapy on its ear"" [my words]; his take on marriage counseling makes a lot of sense. My main reservation is with his apparent belief and insistence that EVERY relationship (except the physically abusive one) CAN BE SAVED. A bit dogmatic, though if you seek help for your relationship, this is a good place to turn to--along with a good therapist! We should remember that most couples who go for ""marriage counseling"" end up divorced, and that's not the fault of the therapist (most people really know they'll split up eventually, I think). But if both partners really want to stay together, this book will help.

Title: Tries too hard
Review: Fun with Dick & Jane is a so-so remake of the 70's original with George Segal and Jane Fonda. Updated in the era of Enron and high-tech electronics, it loses a lot of the innocent, free-spirited fun of the original. Carey, as usual, has some scenes that have no other purpose than to showcase his rubber-faced expressions and Leoni seems rather tired of the whole thing. I actually fell asleep two-thirds of the way through; for a comedy, that's not a good thing.

Review: Fun with Dick & Jane is a so-so remake of the 70's original with George Segal and Jane Fonda. Updated in the era of Enron and high-tech electronics, it loses a lot of the innocent, free-spirited fun of the original. Carey, as usual, has some scenes that have no other purpose than to showcase his rubber-faced expressions and Leoni seems rather tired of the whole thing. I actually fell asleep two-thirds of the way through; for a comedy, that's not a good thing.

Title: A little difficult, not much of a workout
Review: I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's.

Review: Delicious rice pudding which is quick and easy to make! I can't find it in my local stores anymore, though. The packaging has changed, and it is no longer called Americana Rice pudding, just Fat-Free Rice Pudding. Still has the same ingredients, though, and very tasty!

Title: Best spy series ever.
Review: The Sandbaggers is not what most people would expect -- it's about the politics of intelligence wrok, the planning, and most of all, the waiting to here if an op has gone off. The acting is good, the scripts and verisimilitude superb. It's a great look into the espionage game circa 1978-80.The transfer leaves something to be desired, but it's still watchable. Here's a show that could do with a restoration job.

Title: OCCIDENTAL MUSIC
Review: Guitar drags around pounding drum kit and trippy-dippy vocals that shout like an adolescent in teen-angst sexual transformation. This compilation of singles and B-sides is an entirety in itself with the loud rhythmic guitar creating a climaxing crescendo that rises and breaks in guitar heaven in the final two songs, ""Forged It"" and ""Home At Dawn"". Great stuff, and smart too! Superchunk's insights into teen wanderlust and adult misgiving speak to the teen in all of us and if Superchunk had their way they would crawl right back to babyhood and re-utter their very first syllables in the hope of charting a course to a less troubled but less tuneful adult.

Title: received used part
Review: This ACdelco D1922A was purchased on the assumption the part was new @ $114. Corrosion on the bottom and depression marks on the connector seal indicated the ICM was used. The part works but for how long? Stocklift LLC maintains they do not sell used parts. They obviously don't know their inventory. To be fair, had I noticed this before my 30 day expiration, the part would have been replaced. For that I give them 1 star.

Title: You don't need fake food to make quick desserts...
Review: This book was such a disappointment. If I'm going to consume the extra calories, fat and sugar involved in dessert, I want to make sure it's a worthwhile experience. Taking a box of cookie dough powder and adding water DOES NOT EQUAL dessert. I'd rather have a bowl of strawberries with some softly whipped cream to which a drop of vanilla and a pinch of sugar have been added. And what's with the bagged angel food cake? I wouldn't use that stuff as a sponge to clean my bathroom - but Sandra Lee seems to love the stuff. Canned pie filling? Egads.

Title: This one scores a direct hit
Review: Unlike ""Dive"", which drowns in silly lyrics, this album has everything a lover of Brightman's angelic voice could want. Her interpretation of ""My Heart Will Go On"" deserves placement next to Dion's, her rendering of my old Kansas favorite ""Dust in the Wind"" is remarkable, and the Enya-esque track ""Scene D'Amour"" is simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. None of the other 13 songs disappoint, either. Buy it and play it on a rainy day to brighten your mood, or, even better, in a candlelit bedroom.

Review: The book is inspiring if you are looking for something to motivate you in a purist woodworking way. It is not necessarily a how to book, but more of a how to approach woodworking, written in the ""old school"" philosophy of a master crafstman. Hence the title... ""The Fine Art of... "" The version of the book I have is from the 70's complete with all black and white pictures. I probably got more out of this book than others in my woodworking libray of the more expensive glossy fluff books put out by many of the current publishers looking to catch your pocket book with eye candy. There is substance to this book and not fluff. It is not a step by step guide (for the most part).

We use this to prop my wheelchair bound father up when he is eating in his hospital bed, which does not lift him up enough, vertically. He needs to be sitting fully straight to not choke on his food and this product definitely helps him in that area. Great product and could be used under the legs as well as.

Review: Apart from the fact that the main 'heroine' literally talks outloud to herself (And then answers aloud), in their initial meeting the 'hero' saves her from two would-be rapists and then proceeds to bathe her and put her naked in his bed once she faints (creepy!). Oh, and the heroine has an imaginary lover named 'Loverboy' who's existence ensures she comes across as pathetic to readers.This book is FULL of 'huh?' moments and phrases (the above is just the tip of the iceberg).

Oh, and the heroine has an imaginary lover named 'Loverboy' who's existence ensures she comes across as pathetic to readers.This book is FULL of 'huh?' moments and phrases (the above is just the tip of the iceberg). Not a pleasant reading experience.

Title: Not sure why this one is ignored
Review: In 1957 Ms. Vaughan recorded an album at Chicago's ""Mr Kelly's."" It has been regarded as one of Vaughan's best live performances. ""After Hours at the London House"" is the follow-up to that album. The London House was a popular night club at the corner of Wacker and Michagn Ave in Chicago. Now a Burger King (alas!), Oscar Peterson recorded a live album there also. Ms. Vaughan's London House date was recorded the same night after she did two shows at Mr Kelly's. She clearly is tired (that is very clear at the end of the CD) but there is a very cool late night, low enegry vibe to the affair. The recording quality is great, especially on Vaughan's voice. She is backed by a quartet that includes trumpeter Thad Jones.If you liked Vaughan at Mr Kelly's you should grab this CD. At the rate that back catalog is going away, I wouldn't wait too long.

Title: Fails every time
Review: I have purchased one of these for each of my two children within the last 2.5 years. My older child's machine started to fail within 6 months - once turned on, the white noise would fade in and out, or turn off completely while she was sleeping. Same thing happened in less time (3 mos?) for second child's machine. Bought replacement for both, and they're starting to do the same thing. I will be sure to spend more $ on a nicer brand in the future.

Actually my daughter has used it (mother of the child I bought it for)and was pleased with the recipe she used. I would recemmend this book to anyone interested in beginning cooking.

Title: I would never touch it even with a 10 ft pole
Review: What the heck do them people think when they design a printer like Epson Stylus 750. Do they think they will be the only one who will go out and buy and use it. Is that why they don't care to make a user friendly product. An ordinary guy does not know how to configure or do set ups or mess with default settings. The only default we are all trying not to do is on our rent payment. Most average guys lost their brain the last time they did the *\space/ while using computers with dos base ..... So I say to Epson, if your printer is so good, why not buy all of them yourself .................

Title: Lousy Binding
Review: I've read all but ""A Christmas Carol"" in this edition. I've found several typos. Moreover, the binding is becoming unglued. I estimate by the time I finish ""A Christmas Carol"" the binding will be totally exposed. I value permanent books (otherwise I would buy paperbacks). I suggest anyone who enjoys Dickens buy a better edition.

Review: The plot had too many holes. For example, when the USDA inspector was caught in the record room of the slaughterhouse wouldn't the management in reality at least hide the files she discovered the incriminating evidence in? Instead they returned the file so that it can be conveniently found again and stolen by the main character at the end of the book. Not believable.

In the song ""Coke"" they changed the chorus from ""Lie here NAKED with my girl."" to ""Lie here TAKEN with my girl."" What? (...) A band can have a radio hit titled ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" but a reference to nudity is over the line. (...) Buy the indy release of Astronauts if you can still find it. Infintely superior, a near classic. This overproduced version, however, is nothing short of a catastrophe.

Title: Inside Star Trek, the real story.
Review: I am quite convinced that this is a very honest volume, and assessment of the events around the original Star Trek, and it's producer, Gene Roddenberry. The fact that both authors were executives at Desilu studios, and had to agree on the facts, and that both intended to write about it, though with some distance from the original, gives a huge wieght to their story, which is at odds with some other writing and interviews. Events in the book are often backed up with reproduced documents, from thier files. Detail about the workings of the studio are somewhat tedious. Flaws in Roddenberry's character are laid bare, as are the 'adult' activities around the production. People whom worship Trek, or Roddenberry himself may be offended. There are also brutally honest stories of the writers and talent in the show. Definitely for adults.

Title: Such a valuable book
Review: My husband and I left the Word of Faith movement years ago, but not until I heard Hank Hanegraaff's radio show (and subsequently bought this book) did I realize there were Christians out there combatting the false doctrines of the movement.I thank God for Hank Hanegraaff, as he has laid out so clearly in this book the problems with Word of Faith doctrine. Simply put, Word of Faith is unscriptural and contradicts orthodox Christianity. I think any Christian (especially those who've encountered Word of Faith teaching) would benefit immensely from reading this book.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the book isn't the academic treatment of this topic that I would like. I would love, for example, to read a more thorough analysis of how Word of Faith teaching derives from the teachings of EW Kenyon. That said, Hanegraaff definitely documents his sources -- which greatly bolsters his arguments.

I think any Christian (especially those who've encountered Word of Faith teaching) would benefit immensely from reading this book.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the book isn't the academic treatment of this topic that I would like. I would love, for example, to read a more thorough analysis of how Word of Faith teaching derives from the teachings of EW Kenyon. That said, Hanegraaff definitely documents his sources -- which greatly bolsters his arguments.

Title: great art work, unsatisfying story
Review: I was drawn to these books by the art work, which has a mystical quality. Taking the letters out of the envelopes was fun; you felt as if you were eavesdropping on someone's private mail. However, the story teased and promised, but in the end, delivered nothing. It also left loose ends. Whatever became of the guy who was harrassing Sabine?

Title: Zampano's lone album review
Review: I've never taken the time out of my day to write a review, but I will do so to promote Micah. I was reading in a small coffee shop one day and heard an album being played that I immediately fell in love with. I asked the waiter, and he said that he coincidentally went to high school in Maine with the musician and highly recommended checking him out. I did. Many thanks to the waiter. Now just patiently awaiting Micah's next US tour. Check this album out, the one I'm recommending to friends more than any other.

Title: Ouch!
Review: This album is very scary. I wanted to like it as I love Minnelli through her ""New York, New York"" era (late 70s), but she just doesn't have it anymore. Her voice is gone and the wobble in her vibrato is even more pronounced than it ever was. If albums are awarded five stars due to bad singing and poor enunciation, then this would warrent five plus.

Title: Great dress
Review: I was happily surprised with my dress! It is lovely and is a great bargain. The bust does run quite large, so plan to have alterations done on the top. It is a flattering dress on women who are size 12 and up especially. The medallian in the center of the dress is a pin, so it can be removed if you don't like it. I'm using my dress for a bridesmaid dress. I highly recommend this dress!

Title: James Horner: In a League of His Own
Review: I think James Horner ranks as one of the best composers of film soundtracks of our time. Every time I listen to one of his compositions (and ""A Beautiful Mind"", is no exception), I literally get chills. If music is a universal language, then he is able to communicate the brilliant, yet tortured mind of John Nash, Jr. to the audience, which helps us all to understand what this film was all about: love conquering what could have ultimately been his death sentence.

Title: For lovers of 1984 and Brave new world.
Review: I really enjoyed this book. I've only read a few Margaret Atwood books but I enjoyed Handmaids Tale so I thought I would try Oryx and Crake. In addition, I enjoy books such as 1984, Brave New World which present a dystopian future. I found it quite fascinating how she extrapolated current trends in genetics and computing to come up with a very bizarre yet somehow plausible future.

I primarily used this book, it covers everything u need to know. The great thing is that Mr. Foxall actually did thesed xams and understands exactly what they're about and as such does an excellent job in presenting the material. The chapter on Package and deployment and COM are the best i've seen yet! THIS BOOK + TEST KING practice questions EQUALS PASS.

""Any Place but Here"" has one of those sing-along sections that are sure to come back to you throughout the day. The heaviest riffs are delivered on ""This Girl,"" and it's probably the most melodic track as well.The BadVocalist Sal Scoca just doesn't have it. In the immortal words on the American Idol judges, he's just too ""pitchy."" The music is somewhat generic as well.The VerdictCore Records pride itself on producing bands the old fashioned way; molding and developing them over a number of years.

Title: NOT A WORTHWHILE UPGRADE
Review: After loading the software I tried a few of the new features and found some of them to be quite useful.The ability to view thumbnails easily and catalogue has great potential -- perhaps more so for a hobbyist than a professional with thousands of images. However there is not much that one could not already do with Elements 2 and a curves plug in. I believe Elements 2 is a great product. The response and performance of the version 2 is adequate. All the Adobe photoshop products have a learning curve -- but this product seems to be unwieldy and slow. It locked up my machine and took a long time to load.I returned it and will continue to use Elements 2 -- a great product. Not so for Elements vers 4. It needs more work.

It locked up my machine and took a long time to load.I returned it and will continue to use Elements 2 -- a great product. Not so for Elements vers 4. It needs more work.

Title: piracy as 18th century naval tactics
Review: This well written book on Anson and his fleet, heading off in search for the prize of all the oceans (in order to bankrupt the enemy - yeah, right), is a tale of blind navigation, luck and misfortune while circumnavigating the world.While the story of Anson, especially in China and Manila made him a hero in England - I found it interesting to read the East Indies Company assessment of his voyage (disaster) and bumptous behaviour, especially in China. I also thought that since the company had been there for almost 100 years, it seemed most strange that Navy and Civilian (Trader) did not provide each other with any knowledge - navigational or otherwise - two worlds really.The elephantine workings of the ""Prize"" Court in awarding shares was also worth the read... no wonder later sailors always made sure every i was dotted and t crossed!

Title: Great little desk fan
Review: I bought this in spite of a handful of negative reviews up here, and I'm posting to provide a counterpoint.The Zippi is a great little desk fan that, while nearly silent, moves a surprising amount of air. I actually put it down on the low setting because too much air in my face gets annoying. The Zippi is perfect for those of us who work in climate-controlled offices that are a little too climate-controlled in favor of the ladies who need everything uncomfortably warm. It provides just the right amount of personal airflow. No more, no less.Anyone buying this thinking it's going to cool more than their face and torso is sadly looking for something else. Like, maybe, something bigger and noisier.Great for offices/apartments ... bad for cooling large rooms in the Cayman Islands in Summer with no air conditioner. It's made by Vornado and has excellent build quality. I'd buy another if I had two faces.

Title: Exquisite Account of Romani Gypsy Life
Review: From start to finish this book touched my soul and transported me to a time and place that has seemingly long been lost. From detailed descriptions of Romani Gypsy life to personal accounts of his upbringing as a Chovihano, or Romani Gypsy shaman, Jasper Lee fills the pages and the mind of the reader with bright and colorful narratives that compel and draw the reader into another world. This is truly a gem among books, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in any aspect of gypsy life, but especially those interested in the spiritual and mystical traditions of the gypsies and gypsy culture. My hat off to Jasper Lee and his courage in sharing such a personal accounting of his life, his knowledge and wisdom, and in opening us to a world heretofore kept silent.

Title: Very disappointing performance of Dixit Dominus
Review: If the use of 'pedestrian' to describe a music performance is ever justified, this would be it. This is a horrible, horrible performance of Dixit Dominus - this piece demands a lot of the choir, but they don't even try to hit the right pitch. Handel would not appreciate this cacophony. I don't remember much of the remaining on the disc. I was too dismayed that I donated my copy to the school library.

This album is best known for ""Stealin'"" the band's second all-time best-known song next to ""Easy Livin'"" from Demons and Wizards. That one is a classic rocker. However, there are other great musical monents on this disc: The raveup guitar of ""Dreamer"", the gorgeously beautiful arrangements of the title track and ""If I Had the Time"", the physchadellic spaciness of ""Seven Stars"", the gentle acoustic guitar of ""Circus"" and the rock-theatre epic ""Pilgrim"". A standy in the Uriah Heep catalog and of seveties music.

The previous reviewer gets close to the point about this one. I never knew there was so much to using one of these things! It really is akin to swinging a golf club. This is a very detailed book, covering everything from how to hold your wrist to what the loop of the line should look like as it whizzes over your head on the backcast. If I don't catch any fish after reading and learning how to do this stuff then I'm going to be really disappointed. Really!

If I step on it 2-4 more times, it will eventually give me a result that is at least in the right area...but I can't trust it at this point.I had no problems with the BF portion of it, other than it is a pain to get down on the floor to push the buttons.It is asthetically pleaseing, but for the cost, I don't think the weight function works right.

Title: A weak defense of the undefendable
Review: Weiner's book is not so much a survey of fraud among historians so much as it is a tu quoque defense of Michael Bellisle and others who share Weiner's particular predjudices. Yes, Doris Kearns Goodwin plagerized, as did Stephen Ambrose, and both should be (and were) condemned for that. But somehow Weiner turnes this into an argument that Bellisles, who fabricated evidence and lied in support of a false hypothesis, was unjustly pilloried. Somehow, I don't see the connection.

Title: It was good but not great
Review: The Jetsons movie had too much music from Tiffany (Judy Jetson) and is missing Coswell Cog's sprockets, Henry Orbit, Rudy the computer, and a lot of comedy. But other wise it was good.

Title: How many English bands can you name in 60 minutes?
Review: The only reason to buy this is if you want to find out a little (very little) of the history of Oasis. The rest is total rubbish. There is no Oasis music and the few (very few) sound bites are almost unintelligible. If you can stay awake despite the mind-numbing soporific riff which repeats in the background every 20 seconds or so, you will find that the producers seem more interested in impressing you with their seemingly endless list of English bands rather than telling you anything about Oasis. They assert that Shakermaker is a plagiarism of ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"", so obvious, Noel incredibly escaped a lawsuit. Apparently, they never listened beyond the first two bars of the song. Beyond that, ShakerMaker just isn't the same song. If this is an example of the quality of their material, you have to wonder about all the other tales they tell. If you feel you must listen to this, buy it used and then sell it even more used. 0 stars.

Title: Season Two.
Review: This season is interesting bc things are changed up a bit. I like how the selection for models was a lil different, but unfortunately it felt like the talent was bland compared to the first season. More inovated thinkers as far as design goes but they didnt all seem to grasp the concept of the client. Love the show but would love to see greater talent.

Title: Surprisingly Good
Review: Black N' Blue were one of those ""2nd Tier' Hair Metal acts from the 80s....a band that was just as good and talented as the top-shelf acts but for whatever reason weren't that successful. So, it is to my shock and awe that they actually have a new album out. And, just like as in the 80's, this material blows away the more well-known and bigger selling acts!There are only three or four throwaway tracks on this platter - everything else is pretty good. This DEFINILTEY blows away new releases from Bon Jovi and Def Leppard, that's for sure!

Title: The Greatest Rock & Roll Christmas Album Ever!
Review: Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, not a day goes by that I don't listen to at least one song from this masterpiece, whether I'm at home, on the job, or taking a walk. The best and most original song is Darlene Love's ""Christmas(Baby Please Come Home)"". What it means to me is a plea not just for someone to return to one's life during the Holidays, but for something like friendship or respect to resurface. I know about it all too well, because there were times in my teens and 20s(I'm 46, BTW)when I went into Christmas without respect or a job.I e-mailed Darlene's website a few days ago, and her management team tells me that she will make her annual appearance on the Letterman show December 21 to do her signature Holiday classic. Baby please come home!

Title: How the *@#$ can this hack have a best of release?!?!?!?!?
Review: Everyone with half a brain knows that the best & only cast of SNL worth watching was back in the late 80's to early 90's with the likes of Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, among others. Every cast before or since has been nothing but a sinkhole of talentless, boring, pathetic losers trying to be something they're not.... funny. The only way any of these people, especially Will Ferrell, could make me laugh is if they fell down a few flights of stairs and broke thier necks. Please, if you are entertaining the idea of purchasing this dreck, do something more constructive with your money... throw it out the window. That's what your doing anyway.

Review: I love ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" and ""Why did I get Married"" but this movie lacks in all the aspects of film making. The characters are awful except for Rick Fox's performance and the Mom's son ( unknown). It's not funny at all. It has no heart like his other movies. It's just bad. There's also the annoying Lee Roy Brown and Hispanic lady characters. Bottom line, you are wasting you're money if you buy or even rent this movie.

Title: Misses a star for the missing tracks
Review: 5ive is my favorite boyband. Excuse me, *lad* band. I love the fact that they don't sound like most of the other guys out there and they know how to rock every now and then. Too bad the US audience seems to ignore them completely. This CD is pretty good but I've only given it 4 stars because it is missing 4 tracks that are on every other release. It is missing my favorite song, ""Cold Sweat"" and anyone who's heard it can testify to how great it is. My friends and I couldn't stop singing it when we first heard it. If you want 5ive's debut album, try to get an import version. Trust me on this one.

Title: So far, so good.
Review: I took my daughter out for a ride on the WeeRide for the first time this past weekend. The first words out of her mouth were, ""I like this!""She's 2 years old and about 30 pounds and I was a little nervous as I'm not a great bike rider, but it went fine. To test the WeeRide out, first I put her in the seat, held the handles of the bike, and just walked up and down the street for a few minutes. Then I rode the bike with the WeeRide in place but without her, to make sure I felt comfortable. I realized that her seat got in the way of being able to get off my seat and straddle the bike (i.e., when stopping). I adjusted my bike seat to its lowest setting so that I could stand on my tiptoes while leaning forward from my seat. This isn't a good solution for long bike trips, as now I'm not getting a full leg extension, but it's fine for short trips around town, which is all I'm planning to do at this point.After two years off a bike, I am finally back on!

This isn't a good solution for long bike trips, as now I'm not getting a full leg extension, but it's fine for short trips around town, which is all I'm planning to do at this point.After two years off a bike, I am finally back on!

Title: Dusty Shower Curtain
Review: Upon unfolding this curtain, it was coated in some sort of powdery substance. I have not had many death threats and am I pretty likable person so I knew it wasn't laced with anthrax. The powder because a slime when it got wet, so cleaning my new shower curtain has been a chore. It is a very long shower curtain.

Title: solid and good looking
Review: This tub caddy is solid and very well built. We had another caddy for 10 years and I can already tell this one will be better. We are very pleased. So far we've only had it a few weeks, so I can't comment on how well it holds up to rust yet. We really like having the three sections, but I do wish all three areas were a little deeper. We use the middle section for bath toys, and the side sections for shampoo bottles. I made the mistake of buying shampoo where the bottle is wider at the top, which makes it want to tip over no matter what. In the side section of this caddy, it is guaranteed. This should be easy to fix, I just need to buy different shampoo!

Title: Worst movie ever
Review: As others have stated here, this waste of celuloid was rushed out to cash in on the science fantasy/Star Wars craze. It had horrible acting. Horrible special effects that make the old Buster Crabbe serials look like high def masterpieces. A horrible plotline. It was so bad it doesn't even work on a Troma level (and I've seen many of their films). Starcrash (the Adventures of Stella Star) doesn't even qualify as a B-film (more like a Z film?) it was so bad. Save your money!

Title: An absolutely beautiful pen for those who like to write
Review: This is a beautiful and well made fountain pen that's a pleasure to use by those who still enjoy writing thank-you notes by hand and who appreciate the scratch of a fine nib on fine paper. It's definitely an acquired taste to use a fountain pen, but those who still like to write will know what I mean. The pen looks and feels great in your hand and Waterman refills are still available at most stationery stores and online. This is a definitely a keeper pen.

Review: I love this phone! I have had no issues with sound quality or reception what so ever. I use Cingular as my provider and it took a while for me to get both text messaging and web to work as Cingular does not sell this phone and therefore cannot really support it either. They actually gave up after 45 minutes on the phone with me (they were really helpful though), but after playing around with it and using the Nokia site for setting up the phone everything works. I then spent another couple of hours surfing for J2ME applications/games so now I have something to kill time with :) This phone is sweet!!!Brian - San Francisco

Review: When the item was received just arond last Christmas, it was polished shiny and the design was really attractive. However, after we used it and washed, we found the silver color truned little dark (not tarnished yet, but it seems like) and some spots look like peeling.Since we threw away the packing box, we felt not to return it. However, if the merchant agreed to accept the return without the box, we would appreciate it. Therefore, they would learn what the problem was. And they may feedback to the factory.Hoping to receive a good reply from the merchant soon.

Title: Life and Love of Dogs
Review: I thorough enjoyed reading Marley and Me. Josh Grogan has a warm engaging writing style and brings us into his family. He shares with us very tender moments and hilarious antics.I laughed outloud while reading this book and I am not one to do that. I also cried openly at times. If you are a dog lover, you will be able to relate to the stories of Marley.While Josh Grogan is the not the shining example of dog ownership and how to handle specific dog behavior problems, you can tell that he really did love his dog and usually had his best interest at heart. Although I must say I have to question his motives when he returns from Disneyworld and fails to rush to his beloved pets side as he is near death. I know from my personal experience that nothing could have kept me away from my dog at a time like that.All in all I would recommend this book as a quick read that that will bring enjoyment, laughs and tears.

Title: Brilliant Sound Quality, Brilliant Playing, Incredible Price!
Review: If you are like most people who like classical music, you probably like me, won't really be able to tell if Gould is better than Richter or if Richter is better than Van Cliburn but you do know if you like a tune or not. As many of these previously mentioned performer's works were recorded ages ago on old equipment and hence sound terrible, you are better off getting newer recordings by very competent performers who recorded on much better equipment and in this case DDD quality and at a tiny fraction of the price. This album is an example of this; Bach's Suites Nos. 1 and 2 are probably among his most beautiful pieces and they are admirably performed here by Eugen Duvier and the sound quality is excellent. Great value for money and a great album. Highly recommended.

Review: I do not know why so many people thought his PPV was bad. Sure, it wasn't the best PPV of 2008 (which was pretty awesome with PPVs), but it was very good. It sure as hell was better than Survivor Series 07. That PPV was horrid as all the matches were just stuff you have seen before on Raw many times. This PPV has some good matches, in fact the only match I didn't like and knew I was not going to like was the John Cena/Y2J match. WWE needs to keep this PPV with mostly elimination matches. This is the whole foundation of the Survivor Series.

Title: Not his favorite toy
Review: Given as a Christmas gift to 24 month old, 35 lb, grandson. He's an active little guy and loves ride on toys, but he's not very fond of this one. He can get on it easily enough, but it only goes up and down, it doesn't propel itself forward like when we were kids. He prefers his red wagon or Crazy Coupe. Maybe because he can swerve around in those toys.The handle is not comfortable, it stops half around way so my fingers dig into plastic ridges when I pick it up. It was a cinch to assemble, but that's about the onIy positive thing I can say about it. Wish I'd saved my money on this one.

Maybe because he can swerve around in those toys.The handle is not comfortable, it stops half around way so my fingers dig into plastic ridges when I pick it up. It was a cinch to assemble, but that's about the onIy positive thing I can say about it. Wish I'd saved my money on this one.

Title: Honda Pilot owners: don't buy
Review: I was under the impression I had to have these for my 2005 Honda Pilot, which does not have crossbars, to use with the Highland soft-sided car top carrier. These bars are supposed to attach to your car using straps and clips, but the clips did not attach anywhere. Even after jury-rigging the straps, the bars still moved around and did not seem very secure. Was glad I purchased the Surelok Tiedown straps. I attached the car carrier straps to the crossbars anyway for a 6-hour trip, and everything worked fine (probably due to the extra tie-downs). But on the trip home, I did not attach the car carrier to the crossbars (attached side-to-side instead), and nothing budged. So if you have an older Pilot, I don't think you need these crossbars for the ""Highland 10391 Kar Pak Rainproof Soft-Sided Car Top Carrier.""

Title: Bad Reputation gets a great reputation!
Review: I have always been surprised at how little radio airplay Joan and her band receive, especially because like more popular bands like Cheap Trick, she too picks catchy melodies you can remember and rocks them up in similar fashion. She has always been ""Rock 'n'Roll"" and this album proves it!The remastering job is very clear and crisp, the vocals better sounding than my original LP, and the bonus tracks make this a real ""keeper"".For anyone looking to introduce someone to Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, this CD along with "" Love Rock And Roll"" are the two to do it with! Buy it, and turn it up!

Title: An excellent book, but not his best.
Review: It's hypocritical for me to simultaneously rush out to buy every Turtledove book (in hardcover yet) when it comes out, and to also suggest that he's spread too thin writing too many books, but I think that's the case. ""American Front"" is an excellent book, one that would do credit to most any writer, but it's not up to Turtledove's high standards. (Note to Publishers: pay him more money so he can spend more time on each book.) This said, I enjoyed the book and read it straight through. It's a first-rate book; it's just that I know he could do better.

Title: It's fine if you live in the desert
Review: What a disappointment! I usually have great luck with Sony products, but not this one. This unit functions so poorly in humid environments that they've actually printed it up in the ""troubleshooting"" section of the manual! I live in the midwest and would come home in the summer and have to turn on the player 30 minutes before use so that the heat of the machine could ""burn"" the condensation off the laser lens. This is how Sony suggests dealing with this flaw! Even then, I could only get it to work 30% of the time. I took it back after a week and got the panasonic equivalent (only w/ 5 dvd changer!) and have been thrilled with it. Unless you live in a low humidity environment DO NOT BUY THIS!

Review: We purchased this for our daughter who loves to sleep with a light on. she loved this night light and Slept with it every night. The problem is after two months the bulbs burned out and there is no way to replace them. We also purchased a turtle night light for our son and the same thing happened after two months. While the idea is great and the kids love them, these night lots are too expensive to only last 2 months.

Title: Shame on Lodge or Amazon?
Review: I was so looking forward to receiving this 7 Qt. Dutch oven. What a disappointment. This is OBVIOUSLY a SECOND, not first quality. The bottom is not quite level, there's a pin hole size chip on the interior, the lid does not fit at all no matter which way it's turned. I'm not paying to ship it back for exchange because chances are I'd only be shipped another second. Instead, I will NOT BE ORDERING ANYTHING ELSE MARKED ""LODGE ENAMEL"" FROM AMAZON. Yes, the price was a good price. But obviously there is no quality control on this particular product since there's no possibility the lid on this pot could have passed. If Amazon is selling seconds or thirds, THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO STATE THAT A PRODUCT IS A SECOND OR THIRD & let the customer decide if they want to take a chance. IF LODGE IS KNOWINGLY SELLING THEIR SECONDS TO RETAILERS AS FIRST QUALITY, SHAME ON LODGE NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE.

Review: There's not a whole lot about this album that hasn't been done a million times before and a million times better. The songwriting is just lackluster, 2-minute bursts of noise with no real direction or enthusiasm. The vocals are incredibly generic. Not to mention the album is only about as long as an EP, and two of the songs are basically instrumental filler. This band's really overhyped, and they fail to deliver on this album. If you want death metal done well, stick to things like Vader or Gorguts. Leave this garbage to the scene kids.

Title: Great band/Great CD
Review: On a whim, I left southeast Missouri for the Broken Spoke in Austin, Texas on 3/4/99. On 3/5/99, Friday night, at The Broken Spoke, I had the good fortune of catching The Cornell Hurd Band.These guys were great! I was blown away. I couldn't really call myself a Texas swing fan until I heard these guys rock the house.So knocked out by their performance, I had to buy the Texas Fruit Shack CD & Cornell was gracious enough to sign my copy. Like their live performance, it's a great CD!Take it from this crusty old songwriting/musician of 20 years, these guys are the real deal. If you'd like to expand your horizons & really get into the soul of Texas Honky-Tonk, get this CD. You won't be disappointed. The Cornell Hurd Band is proof that even the most traditional forms of hardcore Texas Swing/Honkey-Tonk is alive & well & ever evolving.

On 3/5/99, Friday night, at The Broken Spoke, I had the good fortune of catching The Cornell Hurd Band.These guys were great! I was blown away. I couldn't really call myself a Texas swing fan until I heard these guys rock the house.So knocked out by their performance, I had to buy the Texas Fruit Shack CD & Cornell was gracious enough to sign my copy. Like their live performance, it's a great CD!Take it from this crusty old songwriting/musician of 20 years, these guys are the real deal. If you'd like to expand your horizons & really get into the soul of Texas Honky-Tonk, get this CD. You won't be disappointed. The Cornell Hurd Band is proof that even the most traditional forms of hardcore Texas Swing/Honkey-Tonk is alive & well & ever evolving.

Title: Impressed with this newcomer - Jolof Groove
Review: This CD is really groovin'! A good mix of different musical styles. Really enjoyed the Senegalese percussion, and musicality of the guitarist and singer. This album reminded me of Sting and Peter Gabriel, particularly the songs ""Water"" and ""So the Story Goes"" - but with a whole new twist! I would recommend this CD to any listener no matter what your musical taste, Jolof Groove is definitely the answer!! Can't wait to hear them live and see what new ""grooves"" they come up with!

Title: Its average
Review: ""No Mercy"" for the N64 is the best wrestling game ever made and this one isn't half the game ""No Mercy"" is. This new ""Showdown: Legends of Wrestling"" is way overrated. After reading so many positive reviews about it, I thought they finally got it right. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Its worth renting for the sake of having King Kong Bundy do a body splash onto Bobby Heenan from the top of a steel cage in Madison Square Garden, but I wouldn't buy it.

Title: They taste like my mom made them!
Review: I don't get to eat many cookies but when I do I want them to taste great. You just cannot beat cookies fresh out of the oven for the great taste and the aroma. This mix is nice as you quickly add butter, an egg and bake. In less than 20 minutes you have a nice sweet treat to share with family and friends.My grandson loves to come over and bake some cookies for dessert for dinner. Unfortunately many times they don't last long enough to make it to dinner time. Their life span is pretty short. There is just something about eating them while they are still warm that is just irresistible.Betty Crocker is a good name brand and one you can trust for the highest quality. You should buy some and treat the kids and yourself to something special!

Title: What a Fun Place to Work!
Review: Empire Records is a local music store that is in danger of becomig a big bad chain - Music Town. This movie follows a day in the life at the store in which a famous singer, Rex Manning, comes to do a signing, and the employees trying to figure out how to save their store. I think what makes this movie work is definitely the character interaction. By the end of the movie you love these characters. I think it's a great fun movie.

Review: I noticed this book had not been given one star yet so I had to be the first. It is just as terrible and boring as A Separate Peace. If you did not like it you will not like this book. Peace Breaks Out and a Separate Peace should be ritualistically burned and then have their ashes put in a vault and dropped in the deepest part of the ocean or perhaps launched into the sun so no student will every have to bear the burden of being forced to read them.

Title: Leaves hair greasy
Review: I like to try new hair products from time to time, and decided to give Organix Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum a try. I have shoulder length, medium-thickness hair. I used it twice, and both times it made my hair feel really greasy. The first day, I used one pump's worth and my hair felt really bad all day. The second day I used half as much and got essentially the same results. This was a wasted purchase.

Title: Not for Serious Developers
Review: This book is lacking for more descriptive code examples. Let's face it,most of us learn from step by step examples, and this is where the book lacks. Theory seems to be lacking also. After going through the book I was not able to write a 3D graphics program without copying the authors code line for line (by the way they did not work either). It talks about general theory but is severely lacking on the details of what each line of code does. Therefore leaving the reader not understanding the core concepts so closing the book and writing a 3D program is not possible.

Title: Tammy Cochran still pretty good !
Review: Even though I will always remember her song tribute to her two brothers that passed on, I have the cd but don't remember the exact title without the cd in front of me...I think it is ""Angels in Waiting""? Anyway she still has a pretty voice on this album and the hit song, which is what the title of the album is after is AWESOME and the most memorable for me. It is a catchy tune with a good meaning. All of the songs on the cd she really put her blood, sweat and tears into. It is definately from the heart. I am just so glad she found a new WONDERFUL record label that continues to bring out her beautiful voice in the best possible way. I like it when country artists can put themselves into the music and I love it when they write or co-write the songs, you can tell. Keep up the good work Tammy!

Title: A terrible book that fails to appreciate the understandin Africa
Review: This book is nothing more than a pathetic and inconsistent rant about the minor troubles of a Muslim African woman. It truly fails to incorporate the real pain many extreme Muslim women feel, or the unbelievable suffering Africa is undergoing.

Title: Epic concert.
Review: The concert on the first disc is definitely one of the best, if not the best, Muse concert out there. Splendid performance and quality. The set list feels very complete and amply shows off songs from both Showbiz and Origins. The second disc having a few hours of great behind the scenes videos from the tour. Truly a great buy. However, only four stars because I could not play either DVD in any of my DVD players, could only play them through my computer (Although I did not try a game system).

Title: Starcade Dissapoints
Review: This was suppossed to be the biggest WCW PPV ever....instead it ended up being one of the most dissapointing. The main event was a huge letdown. It was very screwy and not executed properly. Not enough good cruiserweight matches to balance the flow of the show. Too many heels went over the babyfaces in an event where most of the faces should have went over. Several wrestlers no-showed this event as well. I have no idea why a 3 1/2 year old tape is being sold for ... when it was ... to see it live. It may be worth a look because of its historical value, but please don't plop down ... for it.

Title: A nostalgic trip to the past!
Review: This is a vintage album by Latin pop diva Yolandita Monge. We have to note that her early style differs markedly from the style that would characterize her later songs, as is evidenced by ESTILO Y PERSONALIDAD. An amazing performance, nevertheless! My favorites in this album include VIDA and PORQUE DISTE VUELTA A LA CARA. Although at times Yolandita can be quite charismatic in her songs, I feel that sometimes, she puts just a bit much of an emphasis on emotion. However, this CD gives us a great glimpse into her early style. I would heartily recommend it! A great addition to any Yolandita Monge collection!! Kudos to the diva!!!

Title: BASIC AND EXCELLENT
Review: When I listen to a CD, I'm focused on four basic elements: The production, the vocal performances, the lyrics, and the instrumentation. Production is clear, crisp, and a sonic treat. Vocals are great and match up perfectly w/the songs and lyrics. The harmonies are outstanding. Lyrically, there will be two types of listeners -- those who can relate, and those who are in denial. As far as instruments go, these guys (and a girl) are world class. As far as the comments I've read about them "" . . . not finding their voice . . . "" or "" . . . needing a theme . . . "", I have no idea what they're talking about. THe CD is snapshots of life, very basic, and excellent. Get it!

Title: Great Idea, Bad execution
Review: They thought of a great idea. Extremely convenient push button top that you can drink from any side. Unfortunately, they use some of the cheapest plastic around to construct the lid which is easy to break. If they used stronger materials, I would easily recommend this product to all, but unfortunately, the cheap plastic sets it back. I dropped mine once, and that was the end. Shattered the lid into a billion pieces. On the other hand, I have dropped and banged my THERMOS mugs and they are still in working condition.

Title: So boring they won't watch it
Review: You are better off getting some simple flash cards. My 2 1/2 year old grandson cries and runs from the room when I put one of these dvd's in to play. Leap frog keeps him interested, so its not because its a learning video, I believe its the format. The video dispays a word and then says it, over and over again. Sometimes there is a little animation but its confusing because the animation has nothing to do with the word. Big waste of money. There has to be a better way out there to teach sight words.

Title: How un-original
Review: I have not read this book, and could not give it a 0,but the reviews say enough. It is insulting, as a silent-film buff to see ""America's Sweetheart"" under a picture of Julia Roberts...sure, she's a great actress of OUR times, but Mary Pickford will always be remembered and live on through her art of film as the original ""America's Sweetheart."" Anyone who knows of Pickford's astonishing work will agree she set a new standard in film, and it is a shame her pictures are not more readily available on DVD. Some available on Amazon are: Stella Maris, Daddy Long Legs, Little Annie Rooney, Tess of the Storm Country, and My Best Girl. Also Highly recommended is Eileen Whitfield's Biography, Pickford:the woman who made Hollywood. For the record, I have nothing against Julia Roberts, but I can't stand such unoriginality in a title. Julia Roberts has always reminded me of a gorgeous homecoming Queen, who happens to be a very talented (and popular)actress in her own right.

If you like smooth jazz, you will appreciate Diana Krall. Diana is one of the newer artists that really distiguishes herself from the rest of the pack. This CD never gets old.

It is so strange that at first it draws you in and then it quickly becomes one of those books that you keep reading because you know there just has to be a point...some deeper meaning...there isn't. This book is senseless, and often disturbing. Every character in the book is deeply disturbed, and the plot is pointless and often upsetting. I love to read and I feel this book stole a day that could have been spent with a book worth reading, because this one definitely is not.

Title: Very disappointing, and hardly worthy of the Star Wars name.
Review: There is so much interesting work that could have been done with John Williams' excellent source material... but this group chose instead to simple hack Duel of the Fates into unintelligible and repetitive music-kibble. The music is hardly listenable, let alone dance-able. With all the outstanding movie-theme remixes to be found these days, this one is hardly worth your effort or money. You will be dumber for having listened to it. Just stick to the original version of Duel of the Fates... available on Sony Classical.

Title: Very disappointing, and hardly worthy of the Star Wars name.
Review: There is so much interesting work that could have been done with John Williams' excellent source material... but this group chose instead to simple hack Duel of the Fates into unintelligible and repetitive music-kibble. The music is hardly listenable, let alone dance-able. With all the outstanding movie-theme remixes to be found these days, this one is hardly worth your effort or money. You will be dumber for having listened to it. Just stick to the original version of Duel of the Fates... available on Sony Classical.

Title: Both a legal and political thriller
Review: It is unique to come across a book that is both a legal and political thriller, but that is what Brian Haig has accomplished in his latest work. The book is full of unanticipated plot twists and political and military conspiracies. The lead character, Major Drummond, is both aggressive and irreverent, which I found refreshing in this genre. He uses these uses qualities to look past the calm and organized setting and ferret out the turbulent and ugly reality beneath.The book cleverly develops complication upon complication,generated by one disobeyed order, and leading ultimately to an intractable disaster. I found this book to be a bold and extraordinary thriller full of suspense and surprise. A wonderfully satisfying read.

Title: ""Takes a licking, then stops ticking""
Review: You may have seen this quote elsewhere in relation to this watch.It is very stylish, easy to use and feels very solid. I especially liked the weight of the watch and metal band.The analog portion of the watch stopped after less than 9 months.To be fair, I tend to wear a watch 24/7 and I swim, ride my bicycles in all weather and generally don't stop to take off a watch before any activity.After the watch failed, I did some research to see if any others had the same experience and it appears this watch has an issue with the analog portion dying after 1-3 years.Wonder if they'd consider a toggle between digital numbers and digital hands?

Title: Book Of the year? Disappointment of the year!
Review: I bought this book to read on holiday, persuaded by recommendations on the cover that it was one of the Books of the Year 1997 for several newspaper reviewers. I found the repetive style of the book irritating, although I appreciate the allusions to mazes and particularly the 'revelation'at the ending. However, the content was sooo boring! I read the whole of the book - hoping it would get better. Although Larry was a pretty nice guy, at the end I resented the fact I had wasted so much time on such a Joe Average that let life wash over him and then had his mislife crisis! There were some funny moments, good character observations and I learnt some interesting things about mazes(!) so I might try another Carol Shields novel but I would definately NOT recommend this book nor believe the hype.

As I read the story, I will here from my audience:I'm worried my parents are getting divorced.I'm worried my brother is going to beat me up.I'm worried about my new stepsister.The book does offer strategies but it also hints at not letting these worries through the door in the first place.

Review: THIS SHOWS STINKS TO THE 25th POWER. A lame attempt to cash in on fame of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. The cast & the villains are bland & cliche. Even more then Batman & Robin if you can belive that. The action is silly & childish. Even The Carebears Movie had better action then this. The lines & battle cries like ""Let's get Worty"",""Cosma-riffic"" & ""psychotronic"" are dumb and made me wish for the jokes from Milton The Monster. The story is luke-warm at best. I seen better stories on TNA Impact. The animation is choppy ala Pound Puppies:The Legend of Big Paw. The music sounds like it came form the 50's instead of the 90's. The ending is a rip-off because no network in their right mind pick this crud up as a regular series. Overall:If you ever see this tape,BURN IT!!!I gvie this tape a 0 out of 10.

Title: Decent Picture But No Zoom
Review: For the price this is a decent LCD, it looks nice, has a good picture, excellent variety of inputs but it also has a lousy remote and at least one major flaw that ruins it for me. The LT32HVE, and it seems all the LCDs from Syntax, lacks a zoom function to make 4:3 letterboxed sources fill the screen, ie anything shown widescreen on SD cable or broadcast TV as well as some DVDs, VHS and VCDs. You either have to watch with bars on all 4 sides of the picture or stretch the picture to fit the width, leaving the bars top and bottom unchanged and distorting the image. Also, the Olevia logo is very bright blue when the TV is off so it's not good for in a bedroom, unless you like sleeping with a night light.

Review: For the price this is a decent LCD, it looks nice, has a good picture, excellent variety of inputs but it also has a lousy remote and at least one major flaw that ruins it for me. The LT32HVE, and it seems all the LCDs from Syntax, lacks a zoom function to make 4:3 letterboxed sources fill the screen, ie anything shown widescreen on SD cable or broadcast TV as well as some DVDs, VHS and VCDs. You either have to watch with bars on all 4 sides of the picture or stretch the picture to fit the width, leaving the bars top and bottom unchanged and distorting the image. Also, the Olevia logo is very bright blue when the TV is off so it's not good for in a bedroom, unless you like sleeping with a night light.

Title: Never got to use it!
Review: If rating a ""no star"" was possible, that's what it really deserves. I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams! Beyond patching! Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it. I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product. How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump??? That's like blowing it up by mouth!

Title: Looks good but won't play them all
Review: I purchased this DVD player in Dec of 2006. The machine sets up easily and the picture is great, when it plays the DVD. I have come across 2 new releases that this machine would not play. I contacted Phillips and all they could say was that the machine would not play the new ""dual-layer"" discs and no firmware upgrade would be offered. My asceessment seems to be that this machine was manufactured a couple of years ago and they are no longer offering any supports or updates.

Title: EVE 6 Grows up
Review: This cd is incredible. Their lyrics are much more mature than their last album, ""Horrorscope"". The song topics range from suicide, cheating lovers, and the corruption of big city. Every song is a sing-along pumped with awesome guitar riffs and Max Collin's smooth voice. ""Hey Montana"" is one of the most unique songs on the cd. It sounds like a campfire song. The others like the radio single ""Think Twice"" are classic EVE 6 rock songs with some punk sprinkled in. Die hard EVE 6 fans will definitly be satisfied with this album. This cd is also good for people who are new to EVE 6's music. Bottom Line: BUY IT, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!

Title: Probable Boredom
Review: If you choose to read this anemic novel, your probable future is several hours of wasted time. The characters hold possibility, but are woefully underdeveloped, the plot is predictible, contrived, and often silly, and neither the ""magic"" nor the ""mystery"" have any depth.A small strain relating the story of 18th century Rebecca Sparrow has some interest, but the storyline concerning this character is brief. Mostly the story centers around a sullen, selfish 13 year old, her dysfunctional relatives, and her romantic fantasies. A young girl in 7th - 10th grades may enjoy this book. It is at the reading level and literary depth suitable to jr. high school.

Title: And Only to Deceive
Review: The only suspense in this book is what favors it took to secure the glowing grace notes. If the plot or narrative generate suspense, it is only momentary. The mystery here is not about Victorian art thefts, but about what makes an audience. Presumably someone enjoyed this thoroughly trite, contrived, and transparent novel. Presumably some editor forsaw that this audience existed. And in a world teeming with aspiring authors, that is quite an achievement. Mysterious.

Not only does the mystery itself keep you hopping, the anecdotes about the church and its very human population provide an interesting backdrop for the action that all of Kienzle's books share.

Review: The author knows very little about Viet Nam or the army. He apparently thinks the 60 in M-60 stands for .60 cal. and that soldiers put stamps on their letters when they were in the war zone. A patrol goes out without a radio, a soldier calls a latrine a ""bathroom,"" and the final bit of silliness---soldiers fly back to the states not on a jet transport, nor on a C-130, but on a C-47, a two-engine prop job built in the 1930s and never used in the Viet Nam War to fly across the Pacific.If Myers paid a vet to check the book for inaccuracies, he did not spend his money well.Because of the dialogue, the book's subtitle could be The Little Rascals Go To War. Soldiers' talk in this book is often too cute. For those who like mildly homoerotic war stories that little reflect the way things are, this book might be for you.

Title: Casual fans beware.
Review: If you are a casual Boss fan, than this album is probably better off being avoided. It's overly dark and moody, and the sound quality is not there. However, the album has good songs, six of the albums' ten tracks appear on the ""Live"" set, and they all sound much better in that format. I specifically found ""Racing in the Street"" and the title track to be significantly better live. Yes the album is deep and somewhat poetic lyrically, but it is missing the chugging ""cars and girls and Saturday night"" songs that are easier on the commercial ear. Die hard Boss backers point to this collection as a near masterpiece, I look at it as a step back.

Title: Sad story, well written.
Review: What a sad story and life for Danny Stutzman. This was VERY well written and captured me from the start. I have ready many true crime books and some of them blur together or I never think about again. This one stands out amongst the rest.

Title: Viva Corelle!
Review: This our 3rd set of Corelle. We decided to ""retire"" trusty old Winter White and get something more colorful to go with our kitchen remodel. We considered Fiesta because of the great colors but when we checked it out the pieces were very expensive and very HEAVY. So the spouse and I checked out Corelle patterns and found Watercolors.The pattern is beautiful and the colors are more vibrant than when viewed online. We are keeping all our white serving bowls and platters to go with it but will probably buy new ones in the future in different colors. Our only complaint is that the cereal bowls are too wide and too shallow. We will probably keep our old white cereal bowls as they are the perfect shape.Corelle is unbelievable--We've broken 3 pieces in 30+ years and never have to worry about putting it in the dishwasher or the microwave, or about scratching.

Title: My favorite Spanish resource by far
Review: You need to have a basic knowledge of Spanish to really get the most out of this book. However, if you have that, this book goes a long ways towards solidifing all those grammar rules and verb conjugation that you've been grappling with. The best thing about the book is that it's just plain fun to read. You're learning Spanish, but it feels like you're just kicking back and reading the funnies.

Review: We were excited to find a source of Patak Balti Sauce, a cooking ingredient, in the US, and ordered some jars. We were notified that they had been shipped, and given an arrival date approximation, but they never arrived. A few weeks later, we received an email from Amazon telling us that the item was out of stock and that we would have the cost refunded. We did receive the refund. We wish we had been told at the outset that the item was not available.

Title: Perfect Pouff!
Review: I recently cut my hair and have found these brushes perfect to style my new hairdo. The large flat brush is great for lifting the roots and getting most of the moisture out of my hair. Next I go to the small round and turn under my short ends. Last I use the large round to give lift and body to the crown. My hair dries and styles quickly. I don't know if the Tourmaline is the real deal or just marketing, but I have to say that my hair does look shiney.

Title: Smells awful, Time consuming, and take hair out
Review: I bought this first from walgreens, and when I used it it seem to very gradually loosen my hair. Since it was natural , I kept using it but my hair seem to be getting shorter. I thought it was my imagination, however when my Mother told me I lost two inches. I knew it was real. It ONLY straighten my hair about 5 percent and it took out my hair. I could have got a relaxer at that rate which only takes about an hour.

Title: Missing pages
Review: The original writing was wonderful and Twain, of course, deserves 5 stars. However the edition I received, which was printed by Oxford World Classics, was missing pages 123-154. Luckily, I could go on line and actually read those pages (chapters 21 through 25) but that did not make up for the hole in the book that is now part of my library. Very disappointing! This is a classic I had hoped to pass on to the younger members of my family.I rated this edition 2 stars (rather than 1 star) because it did include Twain's ""The Raftsmen's Passage"" in an appendix as a bonus.

Title: No mid range and iPod dock doesn't work
Review: Shipped very quickly, got it with Amazon Prime next day, which I was happy about, but the PA itself is weak. it doesn't seem to have any midrange power and the iPod dock on top doesn't work at all. All I get is popping and crackling and just a hint of music once I finally get my iPod touch plugged in (which in itself is a bit of a pain), even if I turn it all the way up. Also seems like it is a refurb, though not marked as one, as the warranty seal was broken when it arrived.

Title: Michael Jackson's Invincable...
Review: I did not know what to expect with Jackson's latest release, Invnicable.Though I think it is a good CD, I think it sounds like Michael is trying to fit in with a ""younger"" pop world thus making the album sound almost ""artificial"".Maybe I feel this way with this album because of the hype...or the fact that he tries to outdo himself and ran out of ideas thus going with trend rather than his own genius talent as far as production goes. Sure it sounds superb, but like I said...too much like a copy of some of today's artists.The opening 3 tracks as well as the hit ""You Rock My World"" are the highlights for me.There are a lot of ""mellower"" tunes on the second half of the disc which echo a lot of the ""Heal The World"" vibe, but on here it just seems monotonous or out of place. I don't know.Bottom Line: The first MJ album I've heard where I didn't have a ""great feeling"" when I was through listening to it. Another point: It doesn't help that it was over 75 minutes long I think.

Review: i am a fan of the tassimo machine, and many of the t-discs. however the signature blend should be retitled the signature bland. perhaps i just look a fuller bodied coffee particularly in the morning, but this one was exceptionally disappointing to me... take note of the different roast levels posted on tassimos website before buying discs that cost about $.50-$.75 per cup...

Title: Noble Effort Falls Short
Review: Deepa Mehta is a gifted director, and her previous work is highly noteworthy (""Earth"" being the most obvious example). But this was a disappointment on practically every level. The timing and delivery of the actors was awful, dialogue was canned, and production values fell short. Examining the cliches of both Bollywood and Hollywood and looking at South Asians in Toronto in a wry, self-reflexive way is a great idea, but the movie was so awful that none of that was achieved. Noble effort, but believe me, you don't want to waste two hours of your life watching this. Hopefully it was just an anomaly and her next one will make up for it (and she is genuinely talented, so there's no reason to think it won't).

Title: Problems at every turn...
Review: Ordered from this site a black hakama, 70% polyester, 30% cotton.Was sent 70/30 poly/rayon. Amazon or affiliated sellers could not find records of transaction. Tracked down Tiger Claw from package address--no records. Finally discovered (after 3 phone calls), Tiger Claw sub-contracts with a distributor who apparently mailed the wrong item, because no poly/cotton hakama are available at the advertised price. Distributor agreed to refund money, upon return of item. Item was returned two months ago; my account has not been credited as of this time. And they are still advertising the poly/cotton hakama.

Title: ""Classics and Trash""
Review: A witty and accessible argument for the enduring necessity of Shakespeare, Milton, and many of the other ""greats""--not just because English teachers SAY they are great, but because popular culture from ""Star Trek"" to ""Jurassic Park"" keeps them alive andwell. If you set yourself free from the tyranny of chronology, Hawkins argues famously, ""King Kong"" can influence your reading of ""King Lear"" just as much as the other way around.Hawkins was cultural studies before cultural studies was cool, and her work is ripe for a reassessment.

Title: Good Idea, Poorly Executed
Review: I loved the idea of a butter dish with measurements printed on it, that way I could measure without the wrappings... However, the measurements bleed off of the base with any moisture contact -- including the moisture from the butter itself! I did not feel comfortable with my blue butter, and will be replacing this dish with a glass container.

Title: What were they thinking?
Review: Ok, let's think of the most horrific event of our times and rehash it for the children.I just want to know WHAT were they thinking.My boy picked this out at the library because he loves all things cute and fuzzy. We came home to delve into a re-creation of hell on earth. My kids don't know about what happened on Sept. 11th, so for them it was just another book poorly written (especially when unbeknownst to them I'm editing and censoring on the fly, leaving key information out of the story...perspiring over whether brave mole would be going home to baby mole and how I'd explain that one). As for the kids who know what transpired on that fateful day, I say,""Why put it in fuzzy-wuzzy form and force them to relive the horror?""I understand the need to artistically express the pain and emotion of what happened, but can we not subject the kids to the wars of their fathers? At least until they can understand what it all really means. Ugh.

Title: Product Has Changed
Review: I initially purchased this product in 2008 and have used my eTrex Vista HCx mounted on my bicycle's handlebars for the last 2-1/2 years. The snap on the plate that fits into the back of my eTrex broke the other day. I looked up my previous order in Amazon's records and reordered the exact same item. The new piece is almost all plastic and DOES NOT FIT my device. Amazon even suggests this item as an accessory to the eTrex Vista HCx. The Vista HCx has a slot for a memory card for loading mapping data. The space occupied be the slot prevents the back plate from mounting. I do not recommend this product to anyone with an eTrex Vista HCx.

Title: It kicks
Review: In my opinion, it's about the best cd I've ever heard. Daniel gets really emotional on all the songs, which I think is so cool. The lyrics are deep and they actually mean something, not to mention that they were actually written by the singer, which is rare these days. Frogstomp and Freak Show don't even compare to Neon Ballroom. It's not as hard or edgy as the other two, but its lyrics have a lot more meaning, because Daniel wrote about his own experiences and feelings.

Title: Wolves--Endangered or Dangerous?
Review: As a photographer and retired psychologist I am fascinated by human behavior and more recently attitudes about wolves. Over the last few years my husband and I have spent several weeks during the winter in Yellowstone. We began photographing wolves after noticing the numbers of wolf watchers who huddled with their scopes watching the animals. We began to understand their behavior and how the reintroduction to Yellowstone balanced the ecology. We also realized after our visits, how many people feared and/or hated wolves. Naturalist R.D. Lawrence addresses these issues in a thorough way, making a good case for the preservation of the wolf. His opinions reflect what we have experienced first-hand. He explains why the hybrids (wolves bred with dogs or coyotes) have given wolves a bad name. Agree with it or not it? I do--It should be read.

Title: D-12 bring hip-hop to its knees with its new album
Review: D-12 continues in the venues of Eminem with their bangin' beats, flowin' rhymes, and touchy subjects. While not as polished as Eminem's earlier work in The Slim Shady LP and The Marshal Mather's LP, The Devil's Night contains the same bumping bass and harsh lyrics that made Eminem so famous. The album suffers a bit without Dr. Dre's genius at the boards but manages to convey the same raw emotion as Eminem's first two records. While not a classic, it should easily tide those Slim Shady lovers over until Eminem releases his own new album later next year.

Title: Enjoyable Reading
Review: This is another in Mr. Pears' art history series featuring an Italian art police woman and English art historian/dealer. Unlike the prior books, this one takes place in Los Angeles rather than Rome. The change in venue does not detract.The Bernini Bust is one of the more enjoyable of the series.Is there a bust or not? Is it a forgery or not? At least the reader is sure there was a murder early on in this thoroughly enjoyable novel.Mr. Pears' all-to-human heroes go through their usual mistakes and miscues and end up solving the crime. There is also a bit of shaving the ethical edges that always adds an interesting twist or two to these books.What adds to this series is that Mr. Pears keeps the characters - and their relationship - developing. He also adds humor - one can imagine that when Mr. Pears writes about Argyll and Flavia he does so with a wry grin.There's no heavy-lifting in these books, but this book, like the others is a great light, quick read.

Title: No Surface Mount Hardware
Review: I bought these because I wanted to mount them on a wooden deck and they were the only ones I could find that said ""surface mount optional"". If they are indeed ""surface mountable"", there is no hardware in the package to do that. I contacted Intermatic/Malibu and after a week or so they sent me an email suggesting that they may have accessory parts that you can buy from them to surface mount these lights. If you plan to surface-mount these, be aware that you can't do it with the supplied hardware, you might be able to order accessory parts to do it, and if the accessory parts do exist, it will take forever to find and order them.I was able to mount my lights in a hanging position without the parts, so ultimately I was satisfied with the product.

Review: After reading Vinegar Hill, I expected a lot more insight and subtlety from this book. It was not to be found. I thought the description of these middle America, middle income types were trite and often cruel. Do people like this exist? Of course they do. But to make a blanket statement about a whole group is grossly unfair. It should not be assumed that people who don't have much money necessarily have poor taste. The bride's gown was a little much! Amazon recommended this book. Shame on you!

Title: Good Cast, Poor Writing, Defies Logic Then Tried to Get Political
Review: This was a show I really wanted to succeed since I really liked the cast but poor writing, really impossible situations that were never explained and then the Pro-Gun Control rant (which served no purpose for the show) just ended it for me. When you allow poor writers to inject their political views into a script for no reason other than letting them air their political tendencies I give up! Maybe they should bring back Moonlight since this show may survive this season but in the long run it is gone.

Title: Please write a Sequel!!!
Review: There is this Jewish boy named Daniel, who lived in the holocaust time. The story starts out with him going through his pictures from the past while he is on a train with his family going to a ghetto. Before the holocaust Daniel had a wonderful life. But then Hitler issued for all Jewish people to wear something that lets everyone know that you were Jewish. When they get to the ghetto everything starts to go wrong.I like this book. It was very exciting and some what scary. It was scary because of everything he went through. You don't think about how it was back then. But overall it was a great book if you like a book about the sadness and realness of a story. I could not put this book down.

Review: Bongwater's Kramer's second solo album combines, tounge in cheek, and often over-the-top lyrics, with some of Kramer's most clean and complex production. The comparatively minimal use of reverb in the production of this Shimmy-Disc complements the 'comedy' well.

Title: -Holden +Phoebe
Review: Hated this book. This '""coming of age"" book was unfathomable to a teenage girl. Why is this the standard, and beloved book? I felt alienated from the main character and his trifling saga. Worst book I had to read in high school. The only character I cared about was Phoebe--who would have made a much more interesting read for me. Her pain of dealing with her stupid brother was more real than the rest.Good news, though, is this book is increasingly less relevant to 21st century high schoolers. It's becoming a quaint view of the 60s to them, No kidding,

Title: Shadows Fall Have Perfected the Art of Balance.
Review: When one hears a band like Shadows Fall, they would usually associate them with Gothenburg, home of bands like At The Gates and In Flames. However, Massachusett's own Shadows Fall have the Gothenburg sound down to a science. With ""The Art of Balance"", Shadows Fall have effectively balanced clean and heavy, whether it be the vocals or the music itself, in such a way, that it is truly enjoyable to listen to. After hearing their sophomore effort, Of One Blood, I decided Shadows Fall was a band to keep my eye on. After hearing The Art of Balance, I knew my feelings about this band were right. In Flames fans that are disappointed with ""Reroute to Remain"" would be doing themselves a favor to pick up a copy of ""The Art of Balance"".Key Tracks:Thoughts Without WordsStepping Outside the Circle

Title: When it worked, it worked well, but...
Review: When my old Zyliss gave up the ghost I looked about for a replacement. I have other OXO products and am pleased with them, so I gave this a flyer. On the plus side, it's sturdy and very easy to operate. However, I found that most of the time, about four cans out of five, it wouldn't cut the lid completely off. I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one.

But some people including Bunny Stirrup don't want this new family survive and they would anything to stop it.This book looks like it would be fun.

Title: A WORKOUT OR A COMMERCIAL?
Review: If I could have given less than one star on this purchase I would have done so. What a huge disappointment. The dance combinations when performed together lasts for exactly 42.2 SECONDS! And these are not difficult combinations. Her segment advertising her other videos: 3:37, her bio segment 1:03 and her performance segment 4:09. Her performance segment in not even a bhangra dance. It is an average performance of classical Indian dance, more notable for it's interesting camera angles and special effects.I teach dance for exercise and was hoping to learn some bhangra to lend some authenticity to my Bollywood routines. These combination would not even be sufficient to fill the chorus in the music.I will definitely be returning this.

Review: I can't compare these pacifiers to others because they're the only kind we've given to our newborn daughter. She takes them and doesn't seem to have a problem with them. I have a few complaints though- they accumulate gunk where the pacifier attaches, water gets inside the pacifier part when we boil them, and they leave marks on my daughter's cheeks. And because they're so tight against her cheeks, her cheeks are red and moist after she spits it out. I'm going to switch to a different product before they give her a rash. Definitely do not get these pacifiers.

Ruthless police enforce draconian laws on a desperate population whose daily struggle for food and shelter takes up their whole lives.There is a central plot for the main character to follow, but quite frankly, I've forgotten it, so long is it since I read this book.The reader discovers the truth about the source of the misleadingly named Soylent in the book's closing chapters, and may be amused to find The Netherlands portrayed as the Promised Land.Richard Barlowrichardb@groupcsa.co

Title: loud and damages the skin on my neck
Review: A couple months after purchasing this remington ti ms5100, I noticed that it became painfull to shave. It feels like it is grinding the hair from my face and I dare not use it on my neck again. I had to switch back to my 2 year old panasonic that while low on power, it is quite quite sharp (atleast sharper than the remington) This is my first and last remington product. I just placed an order for a newer panasonic.Remington MS5100Pros: Powerful motor, close shave when used with lubricant or wet.Cons: Loud, dull blades, heavy, dry performance is not good.

I had to switch back to my 2 year old panasonic that while low on power, it is quite quite sharp (atleast sharper than the remington) This is my first and last remington product. I just placed an order for a newer panasonic.Remington MS5100Pros: Powerful motor, close shave when used with lubricant or wet.Cons: Loud, dull blades, heavy, dry performance is not good.

Title: Very misleading title - don't waste your money
Review: It is not possible to be a home-based travel agent. As explained in the book, the agencies through whom you have to work to make bookings and get your commissions for airlines require that you have an address that is in a commercial building zoned as such. The book gives you an out by suggesting you work for a travel agent or get one to give you a contract to be an extension of that agency. As a result you have to pay them a setup (or franchise fee) and then you have to split your commissions with them. This is not what I call a home-based travel agency business.

Title: Revier of Enrico Fermi's Thermodynamics
Review: Good book, simple, clear, but very short. I bought this book because it was written by Fermi; I wanted to get some of his viewpoint.This book is often borrowed from my library. Does use Calculus; but math can be skipped if one just wants to browse the subject.

Title: Compact travelling alarm clcoks
Review: My wife and I have been using Westclox travelling alarms for years. They are reliable and well designed. Unfortunately, the new version available in the UK has a touch screen which is complicated and difficult to use in the dark when you are half asleep, and so we had to buy this legacy version from US Amazon (incurring additional postage). The only small cavil is that the sliding control buttons are now bevelled and not as easy to manipulate as the ones on previous models that were available in the UK.

Review: After downloading this cd on a music site i wont mention a few months ago which didnt have all the bonus track on it like this one does. I broke down and bought this one. There is many good songs on here including some of the bonus tracks. There is only a couple weak songs but overall a very good cd to have. When i bought the cd a week and half ago it was 12.99. Now i see Amazon is raising price again. I dont understand why all these old cds arent cheaper, remastered or not i usually dont like to spend more then 10 bucks on a cd. I would like to get maybe her first cd to, but now i see Amazon has raised the price to over 14 bucks! CRAZY!!

Review: Chess. Not much to it. However since i was a first time player to the game, i thought due to other reviews of this game that this would be the game i needed to teach myself how to play. How wrong i was. It's not that this is a BAD game, i guess my complaint is more along the lines of the user interface. I'm pretty well rounded with computers and software, and even i was confused as to how to change games, change boards, difficulty, ect ect.I passed the game along to a few other people, and not to my surprise, they returned the game back to me after about a day reporting the same frustrations that i was having.All in all, i learned to play the old fashioned way, on a real board.

Title: Liberating effect of Russian Revolution
Review: This is the book to find out about the impact of the Russian Revolution in the U.S., before Stalinism. Cannon was the most important of the original American communist leaders-and a great writer to boot. In his easy and colorful style, he focuses on the critical importance of the Russian Revolution for his generation of working class militants. Those who rallied to its banner gave a vital impetus to all later fighters for social change. Among the most valuable lessons are how the communists defended all class-war prisoners, regardless of their adherence to communism, including the story about Big Bill Haywood and the International Labor Defense. Also interesting, is Cannon's appendix on the ""Negro Question"" (as it was then known). I'm convinced by his thesis-that the Russian Revolution and the existence of a U.S. communist party had a liberating effect on the Black struggle in the 1920s.

Title: Everything you could ever want
Review: If you like the Jackson 5 then this album is for you. There are 36 songs on this dual-disc album. It has every single song you can imagine. Personally I am not a huge Jackson 5 fan, but I love MIchael Jackson, and I feel like this album does a great job with the mass amount of songs that the Jackson 5 released. The only problem I have with this album is like most music, is that after a while all of the songs start to sound the same and you really don't realize when a song starts or when it ends, just because it all starts to mesh together, but it is a solid collection of music. I definitely would recommend it to people that enjoy the J5

Title: Did a Writing 101 student write this book?
Review: This book is really, really not good. Topping my list of complaints is how thinly the characters are written. One character is not distinguishable from the next. The plot is not well developed and unbelievable. My biggest complaint (and this goes back to the characters) is what a miserable heroine Isabelle is. She radiates dullness and doesn't really do anything. This book really does appear to be the effort of a writing student, and I couldn't help but think, ""How was this book ever published?"" I gave this 2 stars only because it was published, so maybe there's some greatness here that I don't see, and also because Ms. Bloom does appear to catch up a little towards the end of the novel.Bottom line, you will be disappointed.

This movie really caught my interest for the first twenty minutes, and then really started to drag on. By the time it was to a scene where Gibson was hiding his family out in a some coastal town, I was considering getting up and doing something else. The acting is good and so is the scenery, but British atrocities are grossly exaggerated, and there is little emphasis on the actual war. The whole movie's basically a revenge plot, the villain's so evil that it's hard to believe that there was a British leader like that, and did I mention that the movie's almost two hours too long? Plot and emotion are good, but ""The Patriot"" way overdoes it. I finally resumed interest in the final battle scene, which is impressive. If only the whole movie had been as good as the beginning and the end. If you want a Gibson war movie, watch ""Braveheart"". 2 1/2 Stars

Review: My grandson is a beginning reader. He loved Diary of a Worm. He read it with some difficulty at first and then reread it about 5 times,with much laughter each time. After the 2nd time he could read it easily. This is the kind of book which makes a child want to read.

The Home and Student edition should be for those of us who are not working in offices or are computer experts.

Title: NOT For Shabbat Use
Review: I own and love a smaller manual Hamilton Beach crockpot that I use to keep meatballs warm for the kids on Shabbat. When I decided I needed a second crockpot for soup or cholent for the adults, I decided to go for the fancier model.Disaster struck.On Shabbat morning, I found the crockpot completely off and my cholent rapidly cooling. I blamed myself; I must have done something wrong. But no, it wasn't me. THIS SUCKER SHUTS ITSELF OFF AFTER 14 HOURS. Unfortunately, that's in the small print, buried on page whatever-you-never-actually-get-to in the manual. In other words, this crockpot is completely and utterly unusable for Shabbat.Back it goes.

Title: Best machine and BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER
Review: WOW. I bought this machine over 3 years ago, have loved it every minute of every day (fast brew time, proper 200 degree brewing temperature, great coffee) and yesterday afternoon it stopped working. The heating unit apparently gave out. Called Bunn customer service, they asked for a date code from the bottom, then told me they'd be shipping me a new one and gave me an order number. THE EASIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!! (And let me just say that, technically, I was about two months outside of the 3 year warranty -- but they clearly use manufacturing dates and build in some wiggle room, probably to keep customers happy -- a technique that companies like Sony, Apple, Panasonic, etc. would do well to adopt -- because Bunn just bought my brand loyalty for a VERY long time!) Can't say enough good things about the machine or the company. Job well done!

Title: Another reason it is grand to work for Starbucks!
Review: Luke Temple's music caught my ear while I was making caramel frappuccinos for a gang of My Chemical Romance sheep. The song was ""Someone, Somewhere,"" and I was immediately captivated. Ironically, these fashioncore preteens called the music unbearable, which further validated my interest in Temple's sound. His is a fresh sound very much influenced by Simon and Drake, but I also feel he's on the same musical wavelength as the brilliant Sondre Lerche, albeit a more stripped down one. Luke Temple is true talent and this disc should not be ignored.

Title: CDs are a mixed bag but DVD is just horrible
Review: What can I say, this is one strange package. The DVD has a short biography of Tchaikovsky which is okay but it then reverts to a biographical ballet which places an overwhelming amount of emphasis on the composers sexuality. Tchaikovsky was a great composer. Who cares about his sexuality more than 100 years later? Give me a break. The two CDs have one exceptional performance, Vladimir Spivakov playing the violin concerto. His tone is huge, his phrasing breathtaking and the performance has real fire. The short pieces are also done quite well. The ballet excerpts have really poor sound and dull performances. Finally, there is Derek Han playing the 1st Piano Concerto. It is okay but this is not Mr. Han's speciality. He is a world famous Mozartian and deservedly so. Here his playing is labored and not very passionate. Unless you think is a real bargain, I would avoid this DVD/CD combination.

Title: Dosent even deserve 1 star
Review: Without a doubt one of the most pathetic films ever made. Extreamly bad acting, Stupid camera angles, Most of the time you cant tell what is happening. The transforming from animals to humans vice vera is the worst effect ever, Basicly you see a bird flying and in the next shot (About a second after) the hairy chuck norris is standing there. Punches look so fake its amazing, Incredibly bad directing makes it look like a 9 year old could of done better if he went into the woods with a cam-corder and some pals. The budget is obvisly tighter than an italien waiters trousers and the only reason chuck norris is in the movie is beocouse the film was made by his brother aron nossis! I really really, really really recomend not buying this film.

Title: These bottles suck!!
Review: I bought these bottles for my new granddaughter and have had nothing but problems with the bottom leaking!! She has a problem with gas and I thought these would be an improvement over the traditional bottle--no way!! She sucked so hard on the nipples, she got a blister on her upper lip. We discovered that part of the problem was the bottom ring was too tight, and loosing it slightly helped the baby have to suck less hard. They worked fine when brand new, but after several uses...I have had several lapfuls of formula and she has gotten regular formula baths. We are going to a different bottle now. I do not recommend them other than the fact they are easier to clean.

Title: Mom in NC
Review: We replaced a used Fisher Price monitor that had been given to us that had a couple of quirks, probably from use. We bought the Crisp and Clear and found it to be Tempermental and Hissy. Just turning it on produces hissy, high volume static, nearly every time. Some nights it would awaken us, not with the sounds of our sleeping baby, but with a low hum or a repetitive chirping noise. I guess we'll continue our search elsewhere.

Review: This was an incredibly maddening season - it just seemed to go from one preposterous weakness to another. It STARTED with a nuclear explosion on American soil. Where do you go from there? By the middle of the season (12 hours into the story) everyone seems to have forgotten that we had just suffered a nuclear holocaust! The former president is stabbed by his nutty ex-wife and then...nothing! He, his ex and former Secret Service agent Aaron just disappear. This happens to characters throughout the season. All this may be explained by the fact that the writers publicly admitted that they had no bible - no pre-planned story arc. They were making it up as they went along! This is NOT storytelling; it is the video equivalent of a child attempting to convey a story and continually saying ""and then..and then...and then."" This series gets one more chance with me. If it doesn't show me something next season, that's it.

Title: Purchases made through Amazon.com
Review: I do most of my online purchasing for items such as this through Amazon.com.I think that the information and details given with the item are very good, the costs and shipping rates are kept for you or shown and it makes purchasing products much better when you do so believing the site is secure. I'm somewhat of a novice at it still and I forget to rate my transaction(s) at times but overall I think doing things this way is fine... I find things here, and elsewhere, online that you can't find in the marketplace anymore and that is the real value here to me. I would and have recommended it. And, by the way, this buy of the Jerry Butler music was great... Thank you...

Title: Not Free SF Reader
Review: Extended eulogy journey.Ender, now many years in the future of the actual events of the Bugger War thanks to the usual effects of fast space travel.He is basically working as someone that delivers overextended eulogies or life histories for people after their deaths, and ends up on a planet where he may be able to do something to save a race, rather than destroy one.Unfortunately this is all quite tedious at times, and could certainly do with trimming and rather belabors the point excessively.2 out of 5

Title: GREAT FILM!
Review: A dramatic adventure about a young Amish boy who becomes a witness to a murder. Harrison Ford earned an Oscar nomination for his performance as John Book, a Philadelphia a cop who is forced to flee the city and live with the Amish in order to protect the young witness and his mother, played by Kelly McGillis. The story provides a wonderful contrast between the rough, violent world of the city and the serene, pacifist attitudes of Old-Order Amish. Enchanting music, outstanding cinematography of Pennsylvania Amish Country, and fine perfomances.

Title: In a word dissapointed
Review: Please belive me I love Stephen King and have read all his books (does every review start off like this?) But this one left me wanting a lot more. I think he could have done a lot more character development. Not only with Trisha but Pete and her parents needed more content. I guess I am spoiled. But I really think Mr King is resting on his laurels on this one (reminds me of Cujo).

Title: Very thin, rips easily
Review: This will not hold up with a 3 to 4 year old. Bought this for my son, and it has ripped in so many places! It did rip a little when I put it on and zipped it, but I just assumed it was going to be a problem at the seam. It's not. It ripped right down the middle where I needed it to hold up. Spend more for a better product.

Title: Good overview but not enough detail
Review: SiteServer 3.0 deserves a thorough write-up. This book ain't it. While Harris does give a good tour of the product, he doesn't go into nearly enough detail. The search section, for example, is a measly 30 pages, and most of those are filled with unnecessary screen shots. I really don't need to see what the web page he's talking about looks like...I can go see it for myself. All that page space would have been better filled with descriptions of what you can do with search and how to do it.I think the problem is that SiteServer 3.0 is too big to cover in a single volume. A 3-volume set -- Overview/Install; Knowledge; and Commerce -- would be better. Still waiting for that.

Title: A Superficial ""Puff Piece""
Review: ""Blue Streak"" goes on and on about customer service and happy employees, as though the two are directly linked and create a profitable entity. Forgotten (or neglected) is how much jetBlue's success depends on aircraft utilization (eg. fast aircraft turnaround - copied from Southwest; long hours/day), low fuel costs (eg. Southwest's hedging program), low costs overall (Southwest and AirTrans both beat jetBlue), ability to bypass intense competition (eg. early Wal-Mart and Southwest locations), and ability to fill planes at maximum revenues (eg. using intelligent price discrimination).Recently jetBlue's financial results went into the loss column, and the stock was downgraded. Other airlines are lowering their costs (eg. using bankruptcy court to force union givebacks and shed pensions) and prices, and parking many of their old fuel-guzzlers. Thus, competition is intensifying and it will take much more than employee smiles for jetBlue to succeed.

Title: It worked!
Review: I went off the pill because we wanted to conceive. The first month, I had tons of cervical mucus. Then--no CM for the best part of a year! I had some other health issues that derailed the baby-making, but when we were ready to get back, I bought fertile CM. I took it from around CD 4 along with Mucinex and Evening Primrose Oil (the latter is supposed to help with making high quality CM). That month I had gobs of CM! And, guess what? I got pregnant! So I would say that this works...now, I was also taking EP oil, stopped drinking alcohol and coffee and was juicing, so those things might have helped too. However, it was only with the Fertile CM that I actually got CM.

Title: BrokenBday
Review: First, I was upset because I did not get an e-mail letting me know my package was delivered. Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up.

Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up.

Title: Pretty good, but Shaara needs to learn how to use pronouns
Review: The Last Full measure is the story of the end of the civil war (post-Gettysburg). The book mainly focuses on Lee, Grant, and Joshua Chamberlin. The book definetly gets you into the civil war, but not as much as The Killer Angels. The Last Full Measure is definetly not as good as the Killer Angels, but then again, the Killer Angels won the pulitzer prize.My main criticism of the book is Jeff Shaara's style of writing. It drives me crazy. He doesn't know how to use pronouns. Here is a good example: ""He looked around, saw his horse, held by a groom, began to move that way, stopped, said to Porter..."". Eventually, I got used to the way he wrote.I'd reccommend buying this book. It's a good read and it seems to be, from my knowledge of the civil war, to be very accurate.

Title: Near Perfect Progressive Rock Cd
Review: I had burned the second cd a few weeks before the cd was realesed in stores. I thought the second cd was actually a 42 min song with 8 parts. So I burned the eight parts separtly. At first I was dissipointed. It sounded way to happy and the songs were mostly singing with little rocking improv's. Well After I heard the first cd I totally changed my mind. This Is an Incredible cd, here is a rating of each song, with a 1-5 star rating.1st cd- ""The Glass Prison""-5 stars- More Gutiar Work,""Blind Faith""-5 Stars,""Misunderstood""-5 Stars,""The Great Debate""-""4 1/2 stars"",""Dissapear""- 4 stars, 2nd cd- ""Overture""- 4 stars, ""About To Crash""- 5 stars, ""War Inside my Head""- 3 1/2 stars, ""The Test That Stumped Them All""- 3 Stars, ""GoodNight Kiss""- 4 1/2 stars, ""Solitary Shell""- 5 stars, ""About To Crash Reprise""- 5 Stars, Grand Finale- 4 stars

Title: Vanity & Worse
Review: A wandering, boorish, freshman attempt at literature. A bright shining epic mess at best. The author openly borrows from the classics in a fumbling inept attempt at originality. A heroic bloggers ongoing vain self absorbed diatribe woefully boring. Wonderful companion for trans Atlantic flights when one has forgotten sleeping pills or the bathroom is lacking toilet paper. The author would do everyone a favor if he worked through a few remedial writing courses and honed his craft before butchering the written word with self centered pomposity. An ""A"" for an eighth grade effort. Perhaps with focus, originality and sweat we will see something worth reading emerge. A Roman orgy of self absorbtion,vanity and open embarassment. The work ethic of Shelby Foote would be a very good measure and prime example of great prose and literary craftsmanship.

Review: I am a very open minded person and their *may* be truth behind quantum mechanics but this film fails to adequately go into any detail or true explanation of it. Instead we have a smorgasboard of random statements thrown together interspersed with video that looks and feels like it's half documentary, half early nineties high school instructional video. This doesn't seem like a professionally made movie but rather a half-hearted tv movie. Even if you are open minded and interested in quantum mechanics I doubt this will be your cup of tea.

Review: Okay, it's got great visuals; in fact, they should have had MORE HELICOPTERS and just called this Dragons Versus Helicopters, and done without the plot altogether. Because the plot is...sad to stay...stupid. And when I use that word, I don't mean just a little bit stupid, but way, way stupid. Gosh, it sure was lucky for humanity that there was only the ONE male dragon, and that the females were sort of hive support for it. Just...why did it take through the downfall of the entirely of world civilization to find this out? And why was he so easy to kill once we'd found him? And on and on.So okay, if you're going to spend that much money on the special effects, why not blow a few more bucks on the scriptwriters and not second guess them? This is a movie to watch, for sure, but...with the sound OFF.

Review: ...The dialogue was so artificial and the acting was so poor. It seems that some one tried to mix ""Executive Decision"", that the bit when Dolph tapped the submarine steel hull to send morse codes, Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" martial arts display and special ops background + calling off the attack of fighter jets shooting air to air missiles which miraculously changed into anti-submarine torpedoes but keep on missing the target. I never thought a Harpoon anti-ship missile could be used to shoot down a Mach-1 or more fighter jet. As for ""Agent Red"", well better spend you money on books on genetic engineering or microbiology. As for the containment room, a high school positive pressure cabinet has more chance of containing the virus, which were kept in glass vials so thin that they broke so easily.

Title: Buyer be aware! Potential fraud...
Review: I ordered 90010, and recieved a package with labels 90010. However, after I opened the package and tried the item, I realized the item that is packaged in the 90010 packaging is actually an 90040! It has only counter functionality, without any timer feature that 90010 has. And of course, 90040 is cheaper. I myself consider this action fraud.On top of that, returning the wrong is NOT easy because it was fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. You cannot do it on the web, and you have to call them. And you cannot do exchange... You have to ship it back and re-buy... All of these because the order is fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. A vendor that smells like fraud to me - yes, they packaged 90040 into a 90010 original packaging. Very suspecious. Too much hassle to go through.... I don't suggest you buy this item rom Amazon.com. Go to your local store and buy it.

Title: A big let down
Review: I was hoping this book would be as humors and enjoyable as Sex and the City. Instead I got four stories about characters that were so one dimentional as the book I was reading. Each story ending leaving me feeling I was stopped in the middle of an intersection. Their was no closeure on anyone of the characters. This book is being sold mainly on the authors reputation and is not worth the money. Stick to watching ""Sex and the City"" on HBO. It is much more enjoyable than wasting your time on a book where the characters have no personality or life of their own. This books leaves you feeling let down and suckered into buying a book where the anticipation ends on page one.

Title: Incredible music...
Review: If you love guitar, not just only jazz guitar, you have to listen to this record, definitely on the best guitar CD of 2002 ( well, one of the best guitar album of the last 10 years should I even say ). Sylvain plays with such finesse and technical expertise throughout the whole album, yet keeping it easy to listen to. His acoustic tone is gorgeous, and Jafet and Ceccarelli just are perfect as always on bass and drums respectively. Try and be convinced...

Title: Good Trimmer
Review: This trimmer does a very nice job. I've used it in wet and dry environments without issue. I've even rinsed it under running water while it is on without any problems. So it fits the bill in wet/dry. I am very happy with the ease of attachment and removal of the trim guard. Also the height adjustment of the trim guard and on/off is very easy in both wet and dry environments.

Title: A Must Read For Parents
Review: ""Is He A Man Or Just Another Guy?"" should be part of every family's parenting ""toolbox."" Do you have a daughter(s)? This book will help to raise their level of expectations in a relationship. Do you have a son(s)? This book provides a map to move a boy from guyhood to manhood. I do not know of another book in the marketplace that so thoroughly and completely explores the subject of mate selection. Although my daughters are still quite young, they will have a copy of this book waiting for them when it's time to start looking for Mr. Right.

Title: Couldn't get past chapter 3
Review: I deleted this from my kindle after chapter 3! The description sounds great but it's really a religious proselitizing book. i hate to be hit over the head about jesus, christianity, and so forth. And, when the character is either thinking or talking about church, religion, god and so forth it's in italics. As if I can't get it or something! I found it pedantic, obvious and dull. I don't mind religious references or characters, but this one is way over the top!

Title: Touching and Romantic...a Great Book!
Review: I honestly just picked this book up b/c i kept seeing it places and figured i would try it. It was a really great book and i have recommended it to almost everyone. Not only is the storyline entertaining, touching, and romantic (without being too girly and sappy)...but the author does an amazing job of building the characters. I was disappointed when the book was done because i wanted to keep reading.

Title: Squish the mouse!
Review: I don't know what to say. I bought this album and after hearing it over and over, i cant find any other favorite song other than ""Float On"". Yes, the song before it is fine, and the final two songs are fine. But it is a deception in the sense that its just too weird. Some songs are just too wacky. The horns, trumpets get too wild and a combination of bad music plus the lead singer's voice is a complete catastrophy. All I know is that I wasted my money on this. I expected more catchy songs other than ""Float On"", but there are hardly any other than that one. They have some soft songs too, perhaps too soft. I would not recommend this album. Do NOT waste your money. Instead, download ""Float On"" and that's it.

Title: A Return to Form for Jacques
Review: After generally lacking creativity in most of his books, I had to begun to think that Jacques was losing it, and failing to create any original ideas.This book was a return to form for Jacques. While the principles remain the same: morally good or not good characters whom you could clearly relate to or against (this is a good thing), the concretes changed. This time, the setting is much more unique, the characters are a bit more original, the villains are very, very different from Jacques' previous outings, and the story of family betrayal is intriguing.Definitely one of Jacques' best, and definitely the best of his later books.

Review: Amazon was very fast, efficient and reliable.The product is a cool product, it's light, small, easy to connect disconnect to your key ring, but, it's a big one, from my understanding it's suppose to have 3 different positions, one full and strong light, the other is a weaker light and the third, a blinking light. We bought 2 pieces for me and my girlfriend, both worked strange in the begining, had only one position of pressing then having the light, when leaving the finger off, the light gets off. Mine now work fine with the 3 positions, my girlfriend one stayed the same as was, which is broken I guess.

There have been problems with water leaking from whoknowswhere, the filters are too big, entire unit is flimsy and cheap and today there was coffee all over the floor and kitchen counter.... the carafe is difficult to open and close, the little top plastic lid is annoying and I keep inadvertently changing the clock. The only positive thing I can say about this coffee maker is that it is fairly quiet when brewing but on the whole it is a mess.

Title: Doesn't last long
Review: I'm sad to say that this bike doesn't last too long. I got it for my first son, he played it a few times (not too much, maybe 20 times in all). We just brought it out for the second kiddo to try and he played it twice and it stopped working all together. The screen garbled and it turned off three times in a row and then it wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought it was the batteries at first, but then I changed them with brand new ones and it still wouldn't turn on. I googled and found that the circuit board has issues and many were returned. Wish I'd known that sooner! I do not recommend this toy, it's quality isn't all that great anyway (but my boys loved it), and then it breaks and makes them sad they can't use it.

Review: The book was highly recommended to my twelve year old daughter. Because Annie dislike fantasy and science fiction, I purchased the trilogy based on a brief overview. Annie likes adventure, problem solving, and ""chick flicks"" She adored Legally Blonde and I hoped that <The train to Estelline would be a story about a career girl. What we had instead, was a series of thefts, double dealing, prostitution, murder, child abuse, and manipulative people. I don't need a book for this. Our newspapers and country lyrics are filled with the disappointment, heartache, and lowlife depicted in the book. It is a page turner, but for the wrong reason. I read the book to see how the author would write her way back to anything resembling good story telling. It was also very odd the way the typesetter consistently wrote al1 with the numeral one at the end. I classify the book as a less well written Cold Mountain.

Title: A Concise History of the US's Most Important Year
Review: Mr. McCullough has once again succeeded in writing a readable history book about the early years of the US.I struggle with Non-Fiction books. They take much longer for me to read than fiction and they can at times be laborious.I am happy to report however that this is not the case with 1776.The book helped me to appreciate the greatness of General Washington, and also to understand the sacrifice of all those soldiers that fought for the independence of the US.Great book. I'm now following up with His Excellency by Joseph Ellis.

Title: 2002 - Amazing!!!
Review: The music of 2002 is truly amazing. If you are already a fan, Deep Still Blue will be the perfect addition to their previous albums. If you are unfamiliar with their music why not start here. You not only get a wonderful CD, but you get a bonus DVD with the most spectacular underwater photography providing a visual backdrop to the music as well as some very interesting extras.Pamela and Randy Copus are truly gifted musicians and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next!

Title: Wishing it came in hardcover.
Review: I'm a little disappointed because I'm looking into buying a few of the books about the series. Of the four I'd like to get, one of them is only in hardcover (Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale) and one is only in paperback (this one).I'm not trying to complain, but it would be amazing if this came as a hardcover considering every other book published is available in that form. Either way, I just wish I could have them all in the same format to make them look somewhat uniform on my shelf.

Review: Four stars is not bad for an album tht is not nearly as good as some of his earlier work. ""Booty and the Beast"" and ""One Million Broken Guitars' are both 5 star efforts. Popa is one of the best blues guitarists out there, and I've seen most of them. Deserves more recognition. Maybe it's his crazy psydonym that holds him back.

Review: Great product, the best trackballs out there. I had a customer support issue that was resolved after I escalated it a bit. If you have any problem with customer support, make sure you contact the US office, as their off-site support can be spotty. They need to improve the drivers for Windows 7, but I understand it is in process.

Title: Age old story retold
Review: A very old story retold about the damage rumours can cause. 5 stars for the illustration! Beautiful artwork by Loren Long. I get the feeling Madonna was trying to push this book out too quickly. Her storytelling just seems to be lacking a little in this one. Don't get me wrong - it is a great story with good values to be learned. I really am happy to see that all the proceeds from Madonna's children's books go to a good cause, ""the Spirituality for Kids Foundation"". Something the world is lacking these days. So Keep it up Madonna!

Review: Do not buy this product. The description implies that the clipper attachment is metal and is somehow ""professional"" in quality, but in fact, it is mostly made of cheap plastic with a cheap aluminum clip. The teeth are sharp and not rounded and the overall quality is lower than the standard plastic attachments. I would send it back if the shipping didn't cost more than the product.

Title: Terrific home workout, only lacks a few muscles
Review: This is easily the best strength training video I've ever used, and after several years I am still not bored with it! I love being able to choose one arm, one ab, and one buns workout for a full-body tone-up. My only complaint is that it's not quite full-body as there are no moves for the chest and only one workout has one back exercise. But nothing is stopping me from doing a few push-ups on my own and I am so grateful to have this DVD in my collection.

I can get almost half a gallon of the stuff at CVS for the same price. It's odorless, colorless, tasteless and crystal clear (no dyes) just like this stuff. I use plain old food grade mineral oil for my cutting bored, on my cutting shears for the garden, diamond honing stone ect ect... I use this stuff on any thing you would not want to use a petroleum based oil or to use it when it would come in contact with food (I.E. food grade mineral oil is ~food safe~).And no... you have to actually consume in the amounts descried on the bottle to get the laxative effect (like a table spoon or two worth, that`s not an accidental amount and all it will do is ""loosen"" you up not poison you).

Title: Excellent Book for Beginners
Review: I ordered this book for a jacket pattern and was pleasantly surprised at the rest of the content of the book. As a beginning knitter, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the language of knitting. Sally Melville's book is a great resource to me every day that I knit. The illustrations and instructions are clear and the patterns have lots of diagrams to help. One of the best features (besides the basic instructions - which I need) is the layout of each pattern - she details the skill level, the fit, scale, yarn details and equipment in a quick reference format that has proved extremely clear and easy to use. I've used other beginning knitter books and this one is by far my favorite. I will eventually give away my other beginning-to-knit books, but this one I will keep.

Title: A horrible waste of both time and money.
Review: If only the packaging for this video were a bit softer, I just may have a use for it. I cannot recall ever in my life turning off a movie after only having viewed 30 minutes of it. A terrible remake of an exquisite classic, this film does not deserve to wear the name it bears on the front cover.

Title: Good book. Very informative
Review: This book was wonderful. The vast history in the book was very interesting. I couldn't put it down I had to finish it in one weekend. From reading reviews before I bought the book I thought It would be alot of gross out stuff, but it wasn't. This author really took the time to know what he was talking about. His research was thorough and he also gave credit to anyone who deserved it. This isn't just a book bashing the unhealthfulness of Fast Food, but rather a commentary on what the Fast Food industry is doing to economies and waistlines all over the world.I must admit my parents weren't big on Fast Food to begin with and I never ate that much of it, but now I will not be eating any of it. My husband is a fast food junky, but I am trying my best to steer him away from it. After reading this book, I made it clear that I better never catch him eating a Fast Food burger.Bottom Line: Extermely interesting book. This should be a mandatory book on high school reading lists.

Title: Wonderful
Review: This was my first time ordering all of my books online for my college classes. I was a bit hesitant not being able to see the books before I purchased them, however, it turns out I didn't need to be. The book was in excellent condition, nothing to hinder my use of it for class. It was also much less expensive than I would have paid at the book store here. I haven't read the book yet, but it looks like it will be a great fit for the class.

Title: Useless and poor design
Review: I've used dryer balls for quite some time and I love them. The very first time I used these they came apart at the seam. You have to put them back together every single time you use them. Too much of a hassle when there are better made dryer balls without this flaw at comparable prices. I do not recommend these. As soon as I get new ones they are going in the trash.

Review: While the content was very fascinating, the kindle version was terrible. Most equations and tables were not legible; therefore, difficult to understand.

Title: ""Nikayada"" Buddhist tradition
Review: For those who seek to follow the early teachings of the Buddha in the earliest of the suttas and those who follow the modern commentary of John Peacock and Stephen Batchelor, it is only fitting to research their shared resource, K. R. Norman. Mr. Norman, a former foremost distinguished professor of Middle Indo-Aryan or Prakrit at Cambridge, authors a most scholarly approach and commentary to the translation of the early Pali texts. With this as a starting point it becomes more apparent when later revisions or commentary by subsequent writers are added to the cannon. It is not particularly easy reading nor bed time reading; however, it is most important in understanding the later development of the Theravada Buddhist tradition of Buddhagosa in The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) and the Mahayana tradition of Nagajuna and Bodhidharma.

Title: And He Gave Pastors
Review: I purchased this book for a class that I am taking in Bible School. It is specifically for Assemblies of God pastors. It is excellent reading for these specific pastors or pastors to be in the Assembly of God church. It is biblically based. I found it to be a bit outdated according to the Assembly of God position in 2010. It was written in 1979. It was in excellent condition for a used book and at a very good price. I will be keeping this book in my library as reference material.

Title: The golden age of Arnold
Review: A fellow weightlifter told me I needed to see this if I was into Arnold at all. It's a classic. I am so I did. It's pretty cool. Seeing the classic TV ""Hulk"" actor was a bonus. It's a brief documentary on part of the competition lead in for a few of the big names back then. If you're into body building history and Arnold, it's worth seeing. It's mostly about the personalities and less about practical tips, although there are some. I've watched it a few times for inspiration since buying it a couple months back. The extras are interesting on this anniversary edition, as the guys reflect on the movie with hindsight.

Title: Boooring!!!!!!
Review: Luckily I saw the movie the before reading the book, because I wouldn't have gone based on the book. The book had the complete opposite effect on me then ""Waiting to Exhale"". I enjoyed reading ""Waiting to Exhale"" but wasn't too crazy about the movie and with ""Stella"" I enjoyed the movie but hated the book.I'm a avid reader by nature and I had a very hard time reading this book, I had to force myself NOT to put it down, I could hardly wait until I was finished, it was far too long and too boring and it seemed that it was written in a rush, and the run-on sentences along with the rambling on and on was quite annoying. It seemed like Terry was trying to reach a quota for the amount of pages that had to be written.I would highly recommend the movie (which I saw 3 times) and I will buy the video when it comes out, but I give the book 2 thumbs down. Refund please!!!

Review: I was amazed when this cable was so inexpensive compared to the $158.00 I had to spend to replace it. There was no change in the quality of the HD pictures. I connected my Dish network receiver to my new Visio Flatscreen LCD TV with this Link Depot HDMI cable. It worked perfectly.. amazing.. then I yanked too hard on the end of the cord a couple of times to gain a couple of extra inches.. I pulled the end off the cable. MY FAULT. Unfortunately it was a gift TV that had to be working for Xmas day and since it was the 24th.. off I ran to Best Buy. The only cable in this town to replace it was $158.00. Difference in picture... NONE. Difference in pocketbook.. OUCH! Definitely different in durability, but.. don't yank on it like a rope and it will work fine.

Title: Good book and series -- and comparable series
Review: ""Midshipman Bolitho"" is an excellent and early example of this genre. Bolitho is interesting and by starting earlier than C.S. Forrester or Patrick O'Brian the author provides a different perpective. As with many in this genre, Kent convincingly portrays not only the strategic and tactical aspects of the war, but also the ship construction/handling challenges. ""Les Miserables"" its not, but Kent also explores the society of the time and develops a number of interesting and and sympathetic characters. The series maintains its quality over the next 18 or so books. Those interested in discovering other, comparable series should pursue: C.S. Forrester, Patrick O'Brian, Richard Woodman, Dewey Lambdin or James Nelson. Other, harder-to-locate series for the addicts are from Dudley Pope, Porter Hill, Victor Suthren or Frank Eccles. I would welcome information about other similar series -- also other naval eras, army fiction, or merchant marine.

Title: You must read this book
Review: Don't let the size of this book seem daunting. It is awfully long but worth ever moment it takes to read it. This book is so full of raw and real emotion that it seems difficult to believe these characters and their lives are merely a creation of Wally Lamb's imagination. I honestly don't know what else to say except this is one of those most beautifully written books I've read. It's truly a piece of art, a masterpiece of literary achievement. Wally Lamb is by far one of the best authors in history in my opinion. He is the only author whose books I've read that made me forget that what I was reading was actually penned by someone and not some mystic commentary on the lives of real people. It's astonishing how seamless his writing is. Without a doubt, this is one of the best books I've ever read.

Title: BORING!
Review: I had a tough time getting through this book. I really enjoyed previous Carly Phillips books and just finished the Hot Number, Hot Item, etc.. series before I started this book and I have to say, those were above and beyond better than ""Cross My Heart"".The book was boring and the main characters weren't terribly likeable. Thank goodness Hunter and Molly were good supporting characters or this would be a real dud. Stick with previous CF books - it's ok to miss this one!

Title: Not for long hair unless you replace the chain
Review: The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant.

Title: Bottom of the casebook barrel
Review: At the beginning of this, my first year of law school, I didn't think too much about my actual casebooks. After a couple months, I began to think more about their layout, the organization, case notes, questions, indexes, etc. I began to have favorites, and some that I was less fond of. But until I saw this casebook, I didn't realize casebooks could be so awful. This casebook is badly in need or further organization, better headings, a better table of contents, better editing - in short, all of the details that make or break a casebook.Just to be clear, I am reviewing the second edition, published in 2009. I have also seen the first edition, and the best I can say is that this is, in fact, a significant improvement over the first attempt. But it has a long way to go before any 1L is going to be happy with it.

Title: Disappointing DVD Presentation
Review: I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of ""unethical"" thing!

Review: This book contains many short essays -- the majority of them are excruciatingly funny and also offer thoughtful commentary on Los Angeles life. Reading this book has helped me understand why I find L.A. simultaneously alluring and repulsive. Also the essay on how to analyze someone by the type of earrings they wear has helped me greatly in negotiating parties and social gatherings. You won't regret reading this book.

Review: Indy Cars of the 1950's is disappointing. Nice pictures, but the captions do not really capture the flavor of the period. Technical data is nil, consisting of two pages at the very front of the book. The book unabashedly is tilted towards the products of Frank Kurtis, but contains no anecdotal information, technical discussions, or the like to flesh out the author's admiration. You can read the entire book in a 15 minute sitting. Quite disappointing - Joe Scalzo's book Indianapolis Roadsters 1952-64 is much better resource for this period of Indianapolis 500 history.

Title: Juvenile sci-fi gimmick film.
Review: This strangely over-praised (except by me) film is heavy-handed and overdone in all departments, from the over-acting to the ultra-caricatured characterizations to the various ""clever"" time travel ideas. Most viewers are probably not aware that the ideas are all lifted from well-known science fiction writers. A teenage boy of the 1980s travels back to the 1950s and, of course, we get the usual jokes about the absurdity of Ronald Reagan being president, or of a colored boy ever becoming a mayor, etc. The ""circle in time"" gimmick also gets a workout two or three times. (Once would not be enough, of course.) One gag that really is funny is the time traveler's amazement at a super-efficient 1955 filling station.

The advertised (Parallel within +/-0.0002"" - paired +/-0.0002"") is not true. The 1.5"" pair has deburred edges that has been done with what looks like a deburring buffing wheel. This has left the locating surfaces with rounded over edges. Also the the height difference betweenthe two is .020""(this is not a typo) and not +/- .0002"". I can by cheap China made stuff that is a lot better.Do not waste your money.

Review: On page 377 of this book, the author puts in his own opinion of history and I quote, ""The Mormom rebellion against American was over. Plural mariages faded into history, even though a few diviant offshoots of the main Mormon branch secretly kept this practise alive. No doubt, thousands of good Americans siged with relief at the downfall of Satan, and the triumph of American morality.""I'm sorry, to have purchased this book. I assumed this would be a history of law book, but instead found it a disgusting waste of work, from a biggoted author. There was no need to put down any religion, and yet this author mid book, is calling an entire religion ""Satan"" worshippers. What does that opinion have to do with the history of law???

Review: On page 377 of this book, the author puts in his own opinion of history and I quote, ""The Mormom rebellion against American was over. Plural mariages faded into history, even though a few diviant offshoots of the main Mormon branch secretly kept this practise alive. No doubt, thousands of good Americans siged with relief at the downfall of Satan, and the triumph of American morality.""I'm sorry, to have purchased this book. I assumed this would be a history of law book, but instead found it a disgusting waste of work, from a biggoted author. There was no need to put down any religion, and yet this author mid book, is calling an entire religion ""Satan"" worshippers. What does that opinion have to do with the history of law??? DO NOT BUY!!!

Title: Terrible product!
Review: I have used Vornado humidifiers & wicks for years, and this product, from Filters Now is bad beyond belief. I don't know what material they are made of, but they definitely do not ""wick"" water up into them. I've tried pre-soaking them, re-soaking them and soaking them in detergent - all to no avail. Within an hour after putting them into use, they are totally dry above the water line in the humidifies, and the room humidity plummets. Do NOT buy this product!

Title: This book is not very good.
Review: Ms. Resnick's book seems too self-serving and isn't very detail oriented as it relates to how to get started in investing. After reading this book, I still felt lost. I would suggest another book.

Title: An awesome great game
Review: I had been waiting for this game for more then a year when it finally came out. Obviously i had to get the special limited editiion. the black book was great, the silver sharpie reminded me of my old days as a writer. The game was really awesome, i liked the way you can switch the outlines and graff you do, and how you can change the colors of the graff you decide to put up in the in-game black book. Another cool part is that a lot of famous people helped out in this game, like actors and musicians. Overall this game really reminded me of myself and made me want to go out and paint!

Title: Roland Orzabal Strikes Again!!!!!!!!!
Review: This is Roland's latest single ""Low Life"", which appears on his new and up coming solo album ""Tomcats Screaming Outside"". This CD is a single that promotes his new hit ""Low Life"". The song is literally fantastic and to appeal to the younger generation, it is off the hook! This song has an unusual technoish kind of beat, filled with a monster guitar riff, that you'll catch yourself humming, and it has the usual vocal style of the man himself, Roland Orzabal! A fantastic song by a fantastic artist. I recommend this CD to anyone who is or has been a fan of Tears For Fears *Roland's previous/current band* Songs like ""Shout"" and ""Everybody wants to Rule the World"" rocked the 80s, and ""Low Life"" will rock the new generation of music. New artists are going to have to take a back seat to this song! Way to go Roland!!!!!

Title: Sorry, not a sparkling gem -- over-rated
Review: (This is my first and probably last review, but I feel strongly about this.) I virtually never buy books new -- but I bought this book based on the 90+ people saying it was fantastic... I expected to be blown away, but have been very disappointed. In addition, the text could be written much 'tighter', there is much superfluous copy, ie, seems to be padded to thicken the book.And to add to other negative reviews saying the Greek is not good, I now notice that the endorsers are not exactly known for their intellectual/theological rigor. I can't help but think that these very influential speakers have influenced some of their closer followers to pump this book.I really wish I had known about the free daily email version -- I'd love my $25 back too! Rick seems to be a great Christian, working in Russia 'n all, but this book doesn't come close to delivering for me. Sorry about that chief.

Title: excellent read
Review: The book's an excellent read for both the layman and the science student. It successfully combines historical detail with contemporary implications of Drosophila research. Written in a breezy colloquial manner, it never gets boring while sacrificing only little of the scientific content. The author does abuse the fly sex theme, often resorting to it with specious warrant. The other shortcoming of the book has to do with its physical quality, which is horrible. Seedy five-buck pocket-size thrillers are printed on paper of incomparably higher quality. Judged on the content, though - a well-written, informative, and entertaining book.

Title: A strong, disturbing novel
Review: Dark and disturbing, this chilling tale of a young girl's attempt to find unity and love in a chaotic world is an excellent read. It starts far strong than it ends; Butler's message, while never particularly preachy, reiterates itself too many times. Certainly a fine book for any Octavia Butler fan, and a good ""bridging"" book for non-followers of the science fiction genre. It contains an important message without being overly technical/scientific. Well done, Ms. Butler.

Review: I am a big Stephen King fan, and have been reading his stuff (sometimes over and over again) for over 30 years. I am listening to this one, and I have to say that I agree that the cutsie-pie language is incredibly annoying. It is so repetitive and annoying that it takes away from the story. It makes it difficult to get through and prevents me from caring at all about the characters. It is very disappointing and all i want to do is yell ""Shut up!"" I'm plowing through it because it is mildly interesting. Definitely will not read this one again...

Title: BUYER BEWARE
Review: Not going to spend a lot of time here, but I would not buy another DeLonghi product because of my experience with this product. R.E. Kraus, and 1 other reviewer nailed it. My unit lasted about 10-11 months until it too started leaking water all over the counter. My wife and I unfortunately did not call DeLonghi Customer Service at that time, but after the reviews here on Amazon, I'm confident they would have not stood by their product. I did end up calling their customer service a couple weeks ago, the unit being about a year and half old, and they did nothing, stating it was out of warranty.

Review: The book is boring, boring, boring! Pat Shannon is a TERRIBLE writer. It seems as if she has a thesaurus right next to her as she writes - - trying to insert the most obscure, complicated word possible. I purchased the book seeking information about CHARLES, and since his name was first in the title, I figured this was what I wanted. It wasn't. She made it as complicated (mainly about herself) as possible. This was the only book I could find on his secret love with Pat. I just had hoped for more. Probably a third person should have written the book, but obviously there wasn't one. I would never recommend this book to anyone, even if you are a Charles Kuralt fan.

Title: Nice unit, terrible customer service
Review: I bought this humidifier at the beginning of November as the weather began to getting colder and the humidity level dropped. On the third night while filling the water tank, it slipped from my hands and fell inside of the bathtub shattering into a dozen pieces. I have been in touch with Holmes customer service and both by phone and e-mail. The person on the phone told me the replacement tanks were back ordered until after Christmas and the person who corresponded with me by e-mail stated that it was December 14th. I continue to correspond by e-mail to see if the item has arrived, but I only receive ""canned"" responses from their customer service folks. The unit worked great for the first two nights I used it, but as of now, I'm out over $70 (with shipping) with a humidifier I can't use.

Title: Fun Learning Toy
Review: Purchased a set for my Head Start classroom, and think I may have to get another one. Really popular with my little ones who just aren't old enough for traditional learning styles. These gears are great for individual or cooperative group projects, lend themselves to creative and ingenious configurations, and encourage persistence. Imagine what the kids could do with twice as many to work with! I did leave off the decals that came with the set - entirely too much visually.

Title: Thought it'd be funny
Review: I thought it would be funny but the thing is that the dye is inside of a small backdoor on the soap. The opening is covered with a piece of white cloth or tape or some kind of fabric. It takes a few times of use perhaps in the shower before the dye starts coming out. Either way its black dye and basically I don't think this prank can go unnoticed with the way they back opening is on the soap. darn!

Title: Solid stool, well built
Review: I use this at a stand-up desk, so I'm only sitting in it for a few minutes at a time. Just as well, since the seat is somewhat uncomfortable, rather hard and clearly not intended to be sat in for long periods. That's OK, though, since that's not the point... Overall a serviceable, well-made stool for the money. Very stable, with a wide range of height. The foot rail is easily adjusted and strong - I can stand on it with only a little noticeable deflection.Pros: Durable, simple, easy to assemble, clean lines, stable, easy and big height adjustmentCons: Uncomfortable seat

Title: Lopsided negatively... And who on earth edited this thing??
Review: This is a pretty awful book... I could have written a better one... The authors portray Dusty as emotionally needy, and there is precious little in the book to suggest that the authors even liked Dusty. Whoever edited this thing should find a different line of work. It reads like a lengthy and very poorly written tabloid article! I wish that someone would write more balanced portrait of this artist. It seems that any literature on Dusty is either ""sugar-coated"" or trashy. This book falls in the trashy category. I only hope that the upcoming film of Dusty's life will be more balanced, and sympathetic towards its subject.

Review: My daughter (almost 2 years old) adores this book! We borrowed it from our library and it quickly became a part of her bedtime routine. It is simple with not a lot of overwhelming colors, patterns, shapes, etc. Just the alphabet and some cute dogs. It has helped us in teaching her to pronunciate her letters. I had to add it to her Amazon wish list because I'm not sure we can give it back to the library? lolI definitely recommend this as a great ABC board book!

Review: I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she loves to sing and dance and it was a really good price. When we receive this she turned it on by hitting the buttons and you could barely hear the music I thought the batteries were low so I changed them, and it didn't do any good. You can't hear the music only if it is really quite in the room and when you sing in the microphone you can't hear it very good either.This toy ended up in the toy box with all of the other toys my daughter won't play with.

Title: Wish I hadn't spent the money
Review: I was excited about this saw when it first arrived, and it worked well until the warranty expired. When it went out of square, the autorized repair shop, with direction from Bosch, quoted over $350 to fix and said even that might not do it. They said it had been dropped or run over by a truck, both of which would be difficult since the saw had been on a stand since it was new. The shop recommended the Makita which surprisingly is made in America. I won't be looking to Bosch for quality equipment.

Title: You have to be easily entertained to like this garbage.
Review: Thank god they took this off the air. I bought this DVD without ever having seen the series before. It's terrible. 4/6 episodes are just completely worthless. Two are decent, including the one based on a Heinlein story. Let me say it this way: Stephen Hawking is the host. WTF? Why would you have a guy who can't talk as a host??? This show was poorly made from the beginning.

Review: This being My Morning Jacket's first Album, it is easy to understand the shoddy recording. If you can get past this fact, below you will see the beautiful songs accompanied by Jim James' amazing and haunting voice. Be sure to pay extra attention to song 3, The Bear, which i believe to be the best song on the album. This is a great CD for the existing My Morning Jacket fan. If you are looking to just start listening, this cd may make them harder to appreciate due to the amatuer recording. And, believe me, this band affords appreciation.

Title: Inspiring
Review: This book was a remarkable story of a woman's strength. As I recall the shooting of over 20 years ago, I remember how eventually we all went on with our lives and didn't think about the ways in which one young man with a gun changed so many lives forever that day at the Hilton Hotel in DC. Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by the dedication and will of others and would like to change the world for the better.

Title: Read SB 1 or God by Maddox, more indepth
Review: The speculations throughout this book are very disquieting. Not in the sense that they are possible, but these speculations are truly just that, one hundred percent speculative. The research done is nothing more than general background history which absolutely has no direct connection to Jesus Christ. I do not support or reject Jesus, I only support what is fact and this book goes no further than the New Testament had done for years. The questions posed, such as ""Did Jesus really die on the cross or did he have a spouse,,,are rambled about here with added speculation. I am continually surprised at what the publishing industry prints, better read Karl Maddox, SB 1 or God, Jesus gets a scientific and historic breakdown, nothing beats it.

Title: Annie
Review: A great movie for the whole family if one can overlook the overacting by the cast which actually consists of some very fine actors and actresses. Aileen Quinn as Annie is adorable and does a great acting job. My family representing 3 generations - children, parents and grandparents - had a wonderful time watching this together. The two children, ages 5 and 8, are very sensitive and get easily scared by scary scenes, even in so-called family movies. But this one they greatly enjoyed, sitting on the edge of the sofa because of the suspense but not getting scared or traumatized. This is a true feel good movie for all ages.

Review: I like these gloves because they are tough for working around tools, paint and other chemicals. They lasted a lot longer before wearing out or breaking at the thumbs and forefingers.The only drawback is the medium size is a tight fit, somewhat smaller than typical for a size medium. Next time I will order a large in that brand.

Title: Broken without ability to repair
Review: I used my Oster to blend frozen smoothies. It worked okay. It would eventually get the ice and frozen fruit to blend, but it required a lot of stopping and stirring. It was really loud (but most blenders are). After about 5-6 months of smoothie making, the shaft/axel that goes from the motor to the blades sheered off. As far as I can tell, Oster doesn't sell replacement parts for that problem.

Title: Disappointing
Review: As a great lover of BBC period pieces, I came to this one with high hopes, despite its cancellation. However, there was a reason it was cancelled. The scripts are not good. The acting is fine, the sets are great, the overall conception is a good one, and expectations were high. But it is annoying. They needed to hire Davies or someone to come in and save this thing, but they didn't. It is not worth a second viewing, except under extreme boredom, and therefore it is probably not worth buying the DVD (unless you have a crush on someone in the cast).

Title: What went wrong?
Review: What makes a gripping story? I honestly find it hard to pin down...I remember reading some of the battle scenes in Steven Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"", and actually leaping out of my bed to pace until my heart stopped racing. I was hoping that ""Men of Bronze"" would provide a similar experience, but I'm disappointed.I can't sympathize with any of the characters; the battle scenes are cookie cutter; the descriptions of the surroundings and characters, somehow lacking. I found myself reading with a vague detachment, as if eating a bag of Doritos when I'm really not hungry. And I like Lays better than Doritos.So, mildly dissatisfied, I'm putting the book down before I finish it. I don't want to say that it's a bad book...it just didn't awaken my appetite for more.

Review: In addition to the Bible , the four basic key aids for study are a bible atlas, bible dictionary, concordance, and last but not least a good handbook. After some research, it was clear that Halley's was far and away the most revered and trusted. I found most useful the background and history of biblical people and events that which have made the scriptures come alive. I am amazed how he packed so much information in this relatively small volume. Highly Recommended.

Title: Soldiers Live
Review: Fantastic Journey! I started reading the series one year ago when I was stationed in Korea. I still love book one the best of all the books but I also enjoyed the journey across Glenn Cook's world. Having served as a light and mechanized infantrymen, my feet and posterior hurt all the way through as I read about the company's journeys. The author did an outstanding job of describing the day to day misery of living in the field as a soldier and the bonds of loyalty that develop between men from this shared experience. I was sorry to see all the old and new faces get killed off, but such is the life of a mercenary. I strongly urge Mr. Cook to continue his good work. Once a brother, always a brother. Thanks for an incredible ride.Ground Pounder

Review: i, honestly, am not a moral person. but this book is simply the most shocking thing i have ever read. yes, comparasions to nabakov are valid, but ""lolita"" was nothing, nothing at all like this. the storyline is enough to provoke some uneasy feelings, but the writing itself is a whole other thing. i honestly kept the book off for a while because of it.however, the narrative and detail are stunning. incredibly stunning. one would think it would be on the same level as some patended supermarket trash novel, but it's nowhere near it. it moves briskly, is accessable, and weaves the storyline masterfully.so, overall: good book, but disturbing amorality/depravity/whatever you like to call it can often lead to less-than-favorable thoughts of the book.

Review: I bet you're thinking...""Pokemon? That's something my first grade brother likes."" So true--but even though I think the poke craze is a little ridiculous, this CD is great. M2M's ""Don't Say You love me"", Christina Aguliara's ""We're a Miracle"", Ashley Ballard & So Plush's ""It was You"", and Angela Via's ""Catch me if you can"" are really great songs on this cd. So is Billie's ""Making my way (any way I can.) get this CD! it rocks!

Title: HELPFULL IF YOU ARE BUYING A SCOPE
Review: I bought this book to compare the different products out on the market. I was mainly interested in a rifle scope, but the sections on binoculars and spotting scopes looked complete to me. What I got was a comparism of scope prices, features and specs. I felt this really helped in making my choice. THe scopes were divided into sections for varmit shooting, dangerous game etc. About the only thing I could say is that there are no street prices listed but admitedly this is tough to do because there always is a lower price out there.All in all a great investment for below 25 bucks.

Title: patronizing, fake sounding
Review: This book is superficial and preachy. It is filled with stock answers and suggestions which turned me off and turned off the people I showed them to. It's hard to believe that teenagers would want to read beyond the first page.I also found the language elementary, and the grammar occasionally incorect. Answers to common questions were surfacy. This is a great title with very weak back up in the text. I work in a school as a counselor and have a teenage child, and I'd never give this book to anyone who really wanted the lowdown.

Title: Great Book for the Young and Old Reader
Review: This book definitely lives up to all the movie and media hype. J.K. Rowling is brilliant and Stephen Fry is thrilling. We decided to listen to these on audio-book while driving, cleaning and working, watching the first movie afterwards. The storyline is engaging and enthralling from the beginning. Magic begins almost immediately, quickly pulling the audience into the mysterious life of Harry Potter. Stephen Fry is capable of a wide range of voices; just when you think he can't possibly read as another new character, he excitingly does it. We worried we might be too old to enjoy this series, but Rowling is such a genius author that she writes at a level enjoyable to all ages. Bravo! Read this book and then watch the coinciding film. The movies never please every fan, especially the hardcore ones, but it's always great to see the characters come to life in cinema.

Title: Very poignant.
Review: ""The Man Without a Face"" is a very sad and emotional book, but it is one that will stay with you. Having a rebellious 14-year-old boy as the narrator was a wise choice, especially because of the time period, which is 1972. This story involves a platonic love between a disfigured man and an emotionally distraught boy. The trials and tribulations they both go through with one another is bumpy, but worth it. The era seems too far-fetched, but probably likely. The boy's family life is shameful and problematic (although it is not entirely his fault). And the ending is a sad one, and will leave you thinking about the entire story. A remarkable book. I recommend.

Title: Viewtiful Joe: Good game but a good guide?
Review: I recently picked up this guide to compliment my purchase of the game Viewtiful Joe and this is what I think of it. As I first opened it I noticed it is very colorful which is a great thing and the guide was very helpful. The only cons are that it is very thin with 112 pages. I was dissapointed at how short the secrets section was though. Overall, I'd say any Joe fan that needs help to beat that hard boss or just to read it for fun should pick it up because it is very colorful and detailed.

Title: May do the job, but expect problems.
Review: This is a good machine if you only need to weld a few times a year. As far as reliability, its a lot less than what you would get from a Lincoln or Miller of the same size. Hobart is a division of Miller and ITW. From the inside they are bare simple, but all the parts are extremly cheap. Expect problems. I's suggest purchasing a Lincoln or Miller since they're built with better parts for the money. After the warranty is out you want something thats built to last with few problems.

Title: This workout is great, but there are a few problems
Review: The weight lifting section is wonderful. There are some new techniques that really get to muscles very effectively. The pace is great, also. It moves quickly from one move to another, enhancing your workout.There are two problems I have with the format of the dvd that caused my rating to loose a star. First, you cannot access just the ab section from the main menu. Also, the ""ball"" routine that was advertised on the jacket and beginning of the dvd were not included on my copy at all. There is no mention of it on the menu, nor does it play at the end of the workout. I have no idea what happened to that section.Good routines, but a few flaws.

Title: My 8th graders liked it!
Review: To supplement a chapter that focuses on the ""big three"" - Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster, I showed the beginning and end of this film to my 8th graders. They liked it very much. It helped me show how guys like D. Webster were larger than life in their life time and after. I enjoyed the black and white and the Citizen Kane-ish style, but I think this movie could be redone with contemporary stars and effects. It would be cool. If you like history and old movies, it's a good buy.

Review: To supplement a chapter that focuses on the ""big three"" - Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster, I showed the beginning and end of this film to my 8th graders. They liked it very much. It helped me show how guys like D. Webster were larger than life in their life time and after. I enjoyed the black and white and the Citizen Kane-ish style, but I think this movie could be redone with contemporary stars and effects. It would be cool. If you like history and old movies, it's a good buy.

Title: Not the best toy out there
Review: We got this for my daughter last Christmas, when she was 16 months old. She did enjoy putting the balls in the basket and watching them spin down, but the bat/golf club were completely useless. She never did do anything with the attached balls except sometimes spin them with her hand. Plus, this toy takes up a fair amount of space for what it is. I would say, skip this one and keep looking!

Title: Just what I wanted
Review: I have been using MySQL for years and it's easy to get by with the basic SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements. Recently I discovered the powers of JOIN statements and realized how much more was possible. I have only read a few chapters of this but I'm already impressed. It's just what I wanted because it gives you the syntax and gritty details of each feature without getting tedious and turning into a 1000 page reference manual.I can already tell I'm going to be poking around this book for years to come. I think this does a great job of filling in the gaps for someone who can already write a basic SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT statement but is looking for more. Seems good from a new user perspective too but if you haven't at least looked at some online tutorials and tested some basic statements for yourself then I would recommend doing that and then reading this book immediately afterward.

Title: Works well
Review: I have used this spray for over 5 years to lubricate door and window locks hinges and locks in several seaside homes. It goes on easily and cleanly (not so for graphite based lubricants), and is nearly invisible once it dries. Although the cans look small, they last and last. The products also keeps out rust , which is a real problem for shore houses.

Title: This book is a triple bogey....
Review: As a long-time fan of Bill Murray, I was completely disappointed by this book...the anecdotes never rise above the mundane. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once while reading the book, nor did I once note in an appreciative manner a particularly deft turn of phrase. The Bill that comes across is a know-it-all kind of stuck in his ways, the guy who's undeniably brilliant but probably not that much fun to be around.

Review: I bought this video about a year ago in a local department store. I watched it at home, and needed to stop it after only a few minutes. The instructor was not the type of person that I would like leading a fitness routine. I didn't liked the choreography of the moves, and the people in the backround where doing different moves. So there was no way for me to ever try even doing the fitness routine. I was lucky to sell it to another person! I would not recommand buying this video!

Title: Great for adding space to a small room by going vertical
Review: I got these to create some space for a 13' X 13' room at a brick and mortar store about 10 years ago. They've withstood banging, burning, dust, and stacking. I put everything in them clothing, tools, stationary, you name it. I like the stackability of the drawers along with the durability of the plastic they're made from. They stack well on carpet or bare floors. However, next time I may just get the doors with the shelves, but I'll like these.

Title: The work and life of the psychotherapist Dr Hayao Kawaii
Review: A fascinating and clearly written explanation of the introduction of Jungian Psychotherapy into Japan, its transformation into the mainstream of counseling and group therapy practice and the teaching of psychology, and the influence of the life and work of Dr. Hayao Kawai in the planting of Analytical Psychotherapy into Japan and the promotion of integration of a broad range of psychotherapies in the service of the people of Japan. Still as timely and thought provoking as when it was first published in Japan, it is a book that makes one question the wisdom or otherwise of adhering solely to a single school of psychotherapy in the service of our clients and patients.

Title: Coffee Table book
Review: Looks good. The page layout has a 4x4 picture on one side and a brief description on the other side (1-4 sentences) about each building. The book can be very off on the adress; an example being Morphosis, Caltrans 7 HQ. In the book it's address is 312 North Spring Street, well on the side of the building is a 2 story size carving of the address that states: 100. It's actually at 1st and Main, which you can make out in the 4x4 picture in the book. Hard to get that wrong, but they did. Also, I was looking for purely architecture, not caring too much for interiors, but really wanted old LA and New. This book goes into some newly remodeled spaces and just new architecture from the last 8 years. So all in all it's cute book.

Title: Different from the pictured bear
Review: I was looking to purchase a ""backup"" bear for the Melodies Gund Bear that my son is currently using. I tried first at my local stores, but they all have the newer version of the bear. Different texture ""fur"", different color eyes, no bow but instead has a ""tattooed"" paw and not as stuffed. I purchased this one from Amazon because the bear pictured is the same bear that my son owns. Fingers crossed, I placed my order and waited for the bear to show up. It arrived on time so no complaints - I was quite happy...until I opened the box. What?! It was the newer version of the Gund Bear. The bear in itself is great. The melodies are sweet and the 3 levels of volume are fantastic. The duration (approx. 15 mins) is more than enough to soothe your child. The bear is a great purchase if, IF, this is your first melodies bear but not if you are looking to replace your child's current gund bear (older version pictured).

Title: NOT for walking!
Review: I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I'd read about them, however, these are not walking shoes! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street. They haven't much cushioning, had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight. The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off. Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe. So far, Nike Air Max has provded the best results (for me).Hope this review helps.

Title: Unable to Install - poor Web Site Experience
Review: Purchased this web cam as an update. Have had and used many web cams. It works well on the Mac but on the PC I can not get the INF file to initialize. Worst part is the very cryptic support web site (after spending 30 minutes carefully providing the problem along with screen shots, the Web site invalidates due to a faulty Phone number format (3 times until I simply gave up).Lastly, the drive CD was so warped it would not read (or spin)requiring me to download the drivers.I have used many web cams and have had no problems - now this one is in the rubbish bin as I now purchase a different make. Fool me once, shame on you.

Title: Coffie shop at home
Review: There was a coffee shop near where I worked. They served the best Spiced Chai Tea Latte. Unfortunately, my office moved locations, but I need my Chai fix. One day when I was back in the area of the coffee shop I saw what they were using to make their Chai. It was Big Train. I've been buying this ever since. I love this so much more than the Tazo Chai that they fix at Starbucks. I just make mine with hot water and its good. You'll have to make it into a Latte to get the full coffee shop experience. Hot water or Latte it still tastes the same. My wife who is a coffee drinker says its too sweet or sugary. I've never had a taste for coffee, but I absolutely love this Spiced Chai and have gotten several people at work hooked; your welcome Big Train :)

Title: Excellent sequel to ""Silk""... beautifully written
Review: If you enjoyed ""Silk"", you won't be disappointed with this work. It meets or exceeds the quality of it's predecessor. As always, Kiernan compellingly meanders through beautiful and creepy realities and experiences telling the tale of Niki, Dar, and Spyder. One has difficulty not taking pleasure from Kiernan's writing. Passages like the following one pepper the work in such a way that you cannot help but underline them: ""Ahe she drew another deep breath, a sip of water from the bottle on the floor beside her feet, and started talking, letting the past drain like infection."" As with all her work, I highly recommend it.

Review: Graphics are nice, running around and blowing everything up is nice, walking up to an enemy, beating the daylights out of him while his partner sits there and watches you isn't very nice. Having enemy's randomly span out of walls to run out an fight you isn't nice, repetative gameplay isn't nice, running back and forth over levels looking for the proper key/switch isn't nice. All in all, this game has more not so nice features then nice ones.How did this game get a decent rating from people? Well, alot of people bought Deer Hunter as well.

Title: At least their hearts were in the right place...
Review: I bought this album because I think John Rzeznik's songwriting is the best I've ever heard. I was disappointed with what I heard from these guys. The main problem with it is that they don't try anything different with the music, which is basically the point of tribute cds. But you won't hear any acoustic orchestrated version of Big Machine or punk rock version of Iris on here. All you get is a 3rd-rate attempt by these guys to reproduce some of the Goo's hits. I agree with the other people that I could for a fact do a better job with a tribute cd, as I've played a number of Goo Goo Dolls songs for crowds and actually get a good response...unlike this cd. The only reason I give this 2 stars is that they cited a pizza place and beer in their thank yous.

The format allows the reader to read a short chapter and then put the book down and just soak in the truths that were written. The reader benefits from each chapter and can make daily progress in their communion with the Lord. It is a must read for every serious believer.

Title: What Happened Gonzo?
Review: I was drawn to this book after having read ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail of '72,"" expecting to find a similar tale of '92. Alas, I was sadly disappointed. If ever there was a candidate to take aim at, it was Bill Clinton but for some mystical reason, Thompson let him drift out of his sight. Strange, since Thompson let no one escape his unmerciful eye in '72.

Title: It's junk don't buy it
Review: It's hard to cock, it's hard to load, it's hard to shoot, and then it doesn't even have power to penetrate cardboard. I wanted to give it to my wife, so she could chase rabbits, and stray cats out of her garden, but the effort to squeeze this trigger makes my hand shake too much to hit anything, I doubt if she could even squeeze a shot off. It looks real eneugh in a dim setting to possibly chase away an intruder. Though pointing a fake gun at someone is probably the best way to get your self shot, so I wouldn't recommend it.

Title: Under rated master
Review: You owe it to yourself to hear this man. Wilen had a style that wasn't like anyone else. On this album he exhibits a cool smokey tone and plays these tunes straight ahead. For example, on Mack the Knife, there is no attitude of fake hipness to get in the way of the melody. It dosen't sound like cliched versions of a 50's hipster or someone trying too hard to make something new out of it. My own complaint is that much of the album is played in the same style. If you are spending a quiet evening at home, this is a great disk.

You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves dissing a young gifted, talented, hard working Christian woman. Like everyone else, she is trying to make her dreams come true, and use her gift. My GOD!No, the album is NOT perfect. What is? It may have been overproduced. Give the BSB and Krystal a break. This is her first time recording an album with a label, and this the first time BSB has OWNED a label. This was a test drive for all of them. It was a good first album. It's main focus was just to get the point across that the girl is talented. It's the SECOND album you should all be looking at. They will all improve in good time.

Title: Incredibly Boring & Unoriginal
Review: I love Ralph Fiennes but this film is truly bad. That pharmaceutical companies test and dump obsolete technologies onto the Third World is old news. But when Ralph's wife starts asking questions, it gets her murdered! Please. As if any multi-billion dollar industry would be so concerned about the rantings of a pregnant ding-bat.The real problem, is that you don't care about the wife who is found murdered. She is an unlikeable character; I couldn't wait for her to exit the movie. She is obnoxious, secretive, and you just don't fully trust her. What ruined it for me, is that Ralph Fienne's character gives up his life to find a wife who was a virtual stranger to him; he didn't even know her. Their relationship was barely established, there was no sense that theyhad any kind of emotional connection. Enough said. Boring, boring, boring. And finally, I'm so sick of the SHAKY CAMERA in films these days. It makes you sea-sick.

Title: simply magnificent
Review: Mistrustful is more than a coming of age novel and more than a novel about a young man coming to terms with his sexuality. Mistrustful takes us on a ride for Davis Virginia's first year at Clark Atlanta University. Mr. Jackson's subtle approach to character development leaves you knowing his characters intimately, as if they are ""infused"" in your psyche. He uses dialogue in a unique way to convey information and insights. I found this book to be perfectly enjoyable. It's a fun romp around the life of a young man who's hormones are out of control as well as a blend of life lessons and insights people of all ages can understand and relate to.

Mr. Jackson's subtle approach to character development leaves you knowing his characters intimately, as if they are ""infused"" in your psyche. He uses dialogue in a unique way to convey information and insights. I found this book to be perfectly enjoyable. It's a fun romp around the life of a young man who's hormones are out of control as well as a blend of life lessons and insights people of all ages can understand and relate to.

Title: This series has it all !!
Review: The Lambert Series has something for anyone that is into wild soap operas! The characters are diverse and the storyline kept me glued to my seat until after I had finished the entire 4-bk series. I hope Ms. Murray has another series in mind (real soon) for us (her die-hard Lambert fans!)

Title: Worked great for 4 months
Review: This microwave is a piece of JUNK. It is now the largest paperweight we have in our home. I guess we could leave it plugged in for the clock. It lasted 4 months,a month too long to return to the store. My husband says he plans to install a large eye-bolt and it would make a great boat anchor.

Title: One of the worst movies ever made
Review: While this movie has excellent special effects, it has an incomprehensible plot, robots which for some reason have cultural accents, and some of the worst dialogue I've seen in years. Why was this movie around two and a half hours long??? I seriously cannot fathom why so many people like this movie (and the first one for that matter). Michael Bay made a classic action film in 1996 (The Rock) but he has gone way too far in making over-the-top, mindless, action summer blockbusters. Please do not make a third one.

Title: Dissapointing
Review: I bought Breath of Fire 1 and I admit, it was one of the best experiences ever. It was fresh and innovative. The graphics could have been better, but it was still an epic adventure you can't miss. But little did I know, the second installment, I guessed would be the best game ever but I was mistaken, the graphics are worse and are reinforced by a terrible storyline not even relevant to the first. In fact the cinematics are poor and the battle sequences have done nothing but become more blurry and the special effects have dropped. What's happening? Never buy this game. honestly!

Title: Poor flyer, get a JAWZ instead
Review: I got one of these for my sister's dog. He hasn't destroyed it, but it simply does not fly nearly as well as the JAWZ disc I got for my two dogs. The Kong disc is basically a tank of a disc. My dogs will occasionally play tug of war with the JAWZ on the retrieval and it stands up to the abuse AND is a better flyer than the Kong.

Title: Not Happy with Accuracy
Review: I now have 2 of these thermometers, thanks to a replacement sent to me by Chaney because the first one wasn't accurate, but neather is the replacement. I live within 3 miles of an offical weather regestered station in Pecan Grove Texas called lonestarweather.com. These thermometers are never close to the temp recorded at the weather station. I placed them on a double pane sliding patio door facing north, under a covered patio where the sun never shines so I could get an accurate reading. Today, this morning, they are 5 deg. higher than the weather station, They look nice but can't rely on them for accuracy.Update;After 10 months the batteries are dead, so I went to Walmart for new batteries only to find out the battery cost almost the price of the thermometer. Back to the spring or liquid design.

Title: The best satire of the American public is found here
Review: Nothing is too sacred for it to be lampooned in Mad magazine, to the benefit of us all. Among others, in this book there are sections on:*) If corporations ran summer camps.*) If they had summer replacements in everyday life.*) If the U. S. government bought like the U. S. public buys.*) The lighter side of winter.*) Labor Day cards from management to labor.*) Mad's football roundup for little-known schools and colleges.There is no one better at writing satire of the American public than the staff writers of Mad. The best satire has a bite to it and that found in this book really bites. I laughed out loud at many of the jokes and I am sure you will as well.

Title: Great product, great price
Review: Honestly...my review is very similar to what others are saying. These bottles are easy to hold and easy to clean because it does break down into pieces. I think that the price is great for what the product is, and I like the color variety. I agree that the bottles do not leak as long as you screw them together correctly. As for how much the bottles hold true to their claim? Not sure! First baby! So my reference of more or less is undetermined! So far so good though!

Title: Sadly not a major update
Review: The Shorter OED is too Britocentric and does not cover North American English well. If you live in the US or Canada, the Merriam Webster is a much better work.Unlike the OED, specific dates are not given and only date ranges such as E17 (for early 17th century) are provided.The quotations are given haphazardly for some senses but not others and many words have no quotations at all. You might be better off getting the whole OED if you're interested in the history of words.If you already have the fourth or fifth edition, do not bother buying this sixth edition as sadly little has changed. Apparently, Oxford University Press is more interested in churning out editions in order to pad its bottom line but won't make the effort to truly update the dictionary.

Title: I would give it five, but...
Review: I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement.

Title: Worst Written Book Ever
Review: After watching the movie with my coworker, I decided that the movie was just okay. She explained to me that the book was better (Why does everyone say that about every movie?). I borrowed the book from another coworker and started reading. After struggling to read the first chapter, I almost quit reading it. Knowing what was going to happen, I thought it was going to get more interesting when Edward actually started talking to Bella. I struggled to read the book until the scene with the truck. After this was boringly described I just returned the book to my coworker without finishing it. The movie was better than the book.If the only thing you read is a stop sign then this is a great book for you. For some reason people actually like it. To be on the NYT Bestselling list is an insult to every other book on this list. To put is simply this book was poorly written. You cannot picture the story unfolding even with the movie to refer back to. No descriptive narrative at all.

Title: It's a good, but short book.
Review: This Choy Li Fut book is a pretty good introductory book on the Choy Li Fut system. I've heard of lots of tales about the systems origins, but this has it. Well, don't be fooled by the cover where it says step-by-step guide to the fighting secrets of Southern China's....There's only 2 forms: Five Wheel Stance and Fist. In some points, I'd have to agree with the first comment on this page. It doesn't even describe the movement of the forms. The pictures aren't pretty clear. At least it's more genuine than the Choy Lay Fut book by Lee Koon Hung.

Title: I, The Jury
Review: Very enjoyable film about Private Detective Mike Hammer (Amande Assante) and his investigation into the death of a friend which leads to Run-ins with the Mob and CIA. Fast paced and great funny dialogue from Assante who is very good in this film. Great supporting cast and great chemisty between Assante and Laurene Landon. Solid action scenes and great story. I won't give any more away. Definitely worth a rental or purchase from Amazon Instant. Glad that this was finally available to buy in HD instead of just rental only as this film is not yet available on Blu Ray or DVD. Worth the $11.99 purchase.

Dean always had a special place in our family's heart, and this collection is a perfect reminder of how polished and lush Dean Martin's voice was. The recording is fun and nostalgic, and I am thrilled to have all my favorite Dean Martin songs on one excellent CD. I recommend it to Baby Boomers everywhere.

Review: WOW ! talk about not acctually reading the book. Maybe some of the other reviewers shoud take a chill pill and try reading it again. They never say DON'T feed your baby or just let it cry. It gives very helpful information on making sure your little gift gets a full feeding. The only time they talk about anything that might not be common sense to most is to feed-wake-sleep schedule your little one instead of feed-sleep-wake. I would expect most people to understand it is not nessecery to run to your baby with your breast out at the drop of a hat! Tip: if a baby cries it is okay. Remembering that anything in excess is bad. This book has been recommended to me by some of my most stable clients and I have recommended it to others I know. The four stars is because this is only a guide book.

Title: Could not play it
Review: I received the movie; and it would not play in my blu-ray player. A message appeared saying it would not play in this region. I had no idea what this meant. I only know the movie would not play. I returned it on 11/23/12; and as of today have heard nothing back. I'm now reluctant to purchase any more blu-ray movies from Amazon. I hope this matter will ultimately be resolved.

Title: Useless - Will NOT stay mounted on sink
Review: I bought this water filter and was thrilled with it at first - it was easy to mount to my kitchen faucet and it filtered the water well - great taste and everything.HOWEVER, within 2 weeks it started popping off the faucet every time the water was turned on. I used their mounting hardware that they included and it just doesn't work for long - the filter will not stay attached to the piece that screws into the faucet.So, I got 2 weeks use out of this and that's it. While this is an inexpensive filter compared to some others, only getting two weeks of use out of it makes it a VERY EXPENSIVE and frustrating filter.The whole thing is very poorly designed, as you can see from the other reviews.Save yourself some heartache and buy a different filter.

Review: I just couldn't take it. I don't demand revelatory originality in my escape reading, but this was such an obvious rip-off of LOTR, I couldn't stomach it. Every single element was a blatant substitution for something from Tolkein, and so obvious it was distracting!Instead, I foundThe Belgariad, Vol. 1 (Books 1-3): Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambitand got my fantasy fun. Sure, it's archetypal to the point of cliche, but with its own internal logic and some satisfying psychological insights, so I was able to enjoy it on its own terms, not as a thinly veiled copy of something better.

Title: The best clawhammer instruction video I've seen
Review: The basic clawhammer strum takes time to develop. (Ive been at it for a year, and it's starting to sound pretty ripping now!). This video is great, goes through everything slow, has good songs, which progress from easiest (basic strum) to hammer ons and pull offs, then to doubble thumb, then finally to drop thum, which he says takes you through beginner to intermediate. I think drop thumb is pretty tricky, so I might put it beginner to advanced. Like I said, I've been at it for a year, and I'm not through to the end of the 2nd DVD yet, and can't drop thumb that well. I would also recommend checking out the ""daily frail"" from patrick on youtube.com, as he is a great teacher too. Watch out though, clawhammer is more additictive than crack, and could lead to broken relationships with those around you!

Title: How ""Hard Rock"" would be carried to the next Century
Review: Listening to this latest CD of Gov't Mule, I can't help wonder all these new venue Warren, Allen and Matt have made to approach an epic style of music that started it all. Good heavy guitar and solid backup rythym. Hard rock, spice with blues and jazz manuevers. Contemporary style on an age old music we call ""rock"" which I would say, nobody knows how to play anymore. Noting that this would be norm on how to do this music and bring it all the way to the next century, where the Mule would be leading this task. After seeing Gov't Mule live in Seattle, I decided right there and then that this would be my favorite band from that time on. Talent and the essence of the music is what really counts in the end, too sad you seldom find it nowadays, except for a few exception, like the Mule.

And for any mothers or fathers who are reading this and are having second thoughts about getting this be cause it's Teen, it shouldn't be teen. It should be E ten and older. it's basically most famous cartoon characters (Bowser, Donkey Kong, Mario, Samus and alot more) meleeing eachother untill the opponent falls off the edge. Doesn't sound alot like a T game to me! ANyway, if your looking for...-alot of fun-a non (extreme) violent game-a 4 way multiplayer-a game thats fun to play after a stressful day,GET IT!!

Review: I played this at my friends house and was immediatly hooked. I went out to target and got it the next day. It was soo awaesome. It was excelent how my 2 bros. could play with me on multi-play. And for any mothers or fathers who are reading this and are having second thoughts about getting this be cause it's Teen, it shouldn't be teen. It should be E ten and older. it's basically most famous cartoon characters (Bowser, Donkey Kong, Mario, Samus and alot more) meleeing eachother untill the opponent falls off the edge. Doesn't sound alot like a T game to me! ANyway, if your looking for...-alot of fun-a non (extreme) violent game-a 4 way multiplayer-a game thats fun to play after a stressful day,GET IT!!

Title: Saitek P2600 Rumble Pad PC Game Controller
Review: I bought this together with my Half Life 2: Episode pack but unfortunately the key pad on the controller doesn't want to function on this game. So for me this is a lousy PC Game Controller and I'll not recommend this to anybody.

Title: Not Happy!
Review: I purchased this chain saw as a gift. I received it in two days which was great. It ran for a few minutes after the initial start, then it quit immediately. I called the company and they told me it had to be calibrated for the state I live in. They gave me two places to take it too, one with a 2 week wait period the other with a 5 day wait time. Very disappointing. I have a new saw and no guarantee that it will work. The company I was directed to have the calibration done, told me they have never had to do this for new saw. I have always trusted Amazon to purchase items through but this purchase was a mistake.

Title: The batteries are worthless
Review: I bought these and don't really use them. Only one battery keeps a charge, and that's only for 2 hours. It's cool to see the pretty blue light, but other than that these are in the back of a closet taking up space. I never play Wii but bought these thinking i would. If i played a lot i would hate these more than i hate Apple, but lucky for these, i don't. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to the store prices, look elsewhere. These are filled with failure and get charged with disappointment!

Review: I did not read this book, but I did take a class with the author, Edith Skom, at Northwestern University. She is an arrogant, snotty woman with little care for whether her students are learning. So in the name of all that is good and decent, do not read this book or try to purchase it-- if, that is, there are any copies of her retarded books still extant.

Title: More pop? No thanks...
Review: Obsession from Eighteen Visions was probably one of my top CD's I owned, so I decided to give this CD a shot obviously - I was counting the days until its release.After doing a run through on the CD, I was very disappointed. They seem to have regressed in evolutionary sound, Obsession was much more raw, harder and interesting to listen to compared to this. You can tell that they had major record label influence to turn out songs they could play on the radio.I can honestly say I only like two songs on the entire CD, I hate their single Victim - it's not even that good of a song to begin with!The only songs I can say are worth listening to are Black And Bruised, and The Sweetest Memory. Although even the best of the best on this CD are still sub par compared to anything on Obsession.It saddens me when bands lose their sound, because that's what happened with Eighteen Visions.

Title: Broke in a month or two
Review: Nice little cooker, but the button broke in about 2 months. I took it apart to try to fix it and the button is held on by two tiny screws into little plastic holders that were broken and ruined. I'm not hamfisted, so not a very strong setup for the only moving button on the thing. Oh well, that's why it's $15. Makes me mad though because now it's in the landfill and I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks (or more like 25 cents) so it would last longer.

Title: Dark forces meet Film Noir
Review: I am a fan of this sort of thing but found myself being bored of the Soap Opera which Buffy became and was really happy with the dark, film noir aspects of this series.Angel is a dark, batman like figure who would prefer to do his part and return to the shadows of his home to brood and revell in his lost love and cursed life (Not a bad concept, but old fast), so you introduce the quirky ex Buffy character Cordellia (played by the extremely hot Charisma Carpenter) and the likeable Irish sidekick Doyle and you have comic relief and a way to get into the plot through the fact that Doyle recieves visions of people in need of help.I really enjoyed this series which was moving in parts and even had some chilling moments (rare these days).I feel the show went down hill after this series, but this series holds true to a great concept (that darkness is just under everyday life).It's up there with the greats such as, Night Stalker and the early Xfiles series.Check this out.

Title: AT LAST!!!
Review: I have always loved Cyndi Laupers voice and knew it was powerful. However, I was so saddened when I purchased this album. I felt that the only good song on this album was AT LAST!!! It was done so well, yet the other songs were remakes of classics in such a strange unrecognizable way. I found this album horrible, its the music that follows the songs and the restructuring of the classic songs that ruined it for me. I think Cyndi could have performed these songs with classic melody and displayed her voice more. SHe is so gorgeous and talented and has so much power behind her voice. I will say that the song AT LAST rocks!!! I also thought Making Whoopi was kind of cute. I just felt so let down by the rest of this album.

Title: The only dog toy I've ever returned
Review: I was really disappointed in this toy. I bought it to keep my dog busy. She is a chewer, but she has never bothered to chew up rope toys before, so I thought this would be a good fit. Unfortunately, she DID chew up the rope--maybe because there were treats on the other end of it inside the bottle. This wouldn't be a problem if the rope was replaceable. It isn't.

Title: Ambitious, but...
Review: On the plus side, this is ambitious, creative, original writing.On the negative side, the narrative is often incoherent, and sometimes so emotionally shattering that one longs for it to end. It is also marred by a persistent ""Aren't I clever?"" whispering around the edges of the text.Overall, it is worth reading if you have some spare time, but seriously flawed.

Title: Terrible
Review: Yeah, I know this song is almost 13 years old, but I came across it the other night for the first time in years. I was so repulsed that it moved me to officially vent. I hated it then, and I still hate it.These guys (especially Fluff Daddy) are a big part of the reason that music has gone down so much in quality. They take someone else's music and then mumble on top of it and think they are artists. Seriously, these guys talk like their mouths are filled with marbles or marshmallows. Just when you think it can't get any worse, The Notorious P.I.G. chimes in to say, ""I've got even more marshmallows in my mouth and I can still rap!"" Well, you won the round of Chubby Bunny, guys, but we all lose.

Title: My first Durutti Column purchase..this one is a keeper...
Review: Wow. Someone Else's Party just showed up on my doorstep today. I was captured by Requiem for Mother on Radio Paradise and bought this album on a whim (I trust RP's judgement immensely)...I am VERY happy...I can tell this is going to be one that just keeps spinning and spinning. I am new to Durutti Column/Vini Reilly but can tell that I will be listening to all I can find - this music just completely defies categorization...somebody called it offbeat and trippy - which definitely apply. The guitar playing is just sublime and masterful...and unlike ANYTHING I've heard come out of a chunk of wood and some steel strings before...classical, flamenco, rock influences all around, but blended with clearly virtuoso talent. Wow. This one is special.

Title: Worst test prep book I have ever used.
Review: As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time.

Title: Robust and Intense
Review: Raajeswari Padmanabhan, whether the pace is fast or slow, plays the veena with an intense attack and robust vigor that distinguishes her from most of her fellow virtuosi on this distinctive South Indian instrument. This approach may lack some subtlety but it makes for vibrations of energy that involve the listener's entire body. You don't just hear it, you experience it.Equally invigorating is the unnamed mridangam drummer, who may or may not be her daughter. My suspicion is that the drummer is uncredited, and the daughter is playing a backup veena, quite common in this sort of music. Voyager, noted for its scanty notes, is no help in solving this mystery. At least they do name the principal artist, which most of the time they don't.

Title: GSW-33 Fixed My Whole House Fan
Review: This switch was just what I needed to fix my two-speed whole house fan. The old switch operated roughly ever since it was new, and finally jammed after many years of use. This one operates much more smoothly. I didn't have to enlarge the mounting hole at all. This switch comes with a nylon pull-cord extension, which I replaced withe chain extension from the old switch.

Review: I can't believe that they rearranged the Insert/Home/Delete/End/PgUp/PgDn keys! Being a veteran computer user, gamer, and touch-typist, this keyboard is useless to me. Every time I go to hit one of these keys, I end up hitting the wrong one. Whose bright idea was it to change this key layout that's been working for more than 15 years???

Review: This music from an early-70s concert is great. The only reason for the low ranking is that all these tracks are available on ""Black Myth/Out in Space [LIVE],"" available in August 2005 from Amazon. The latter release gives you two CDs, not one, from two concerts, not one - and for a slightly lower price. ""End of World,"" however, gives you cool cover art by Jerome Bosch.

Title: Show Boat Scenario for Orchestra: Glorious and Forgotten
Review: Well, nearly forgotten, and undeservedly forgotten. Does it transport me to another world because I first heard it when young and impressionable? No, there's beauty and emotional power in the music that makes listening an adventure every time, and I feel sorry for anyone not swept away by it. This is the best recording of several I've heard, my only complaint being the ""distant"" banjo. Altogether, it's an excellent performance and recording. (And by all means, avoid John Mauceri's version with its heartless cuts.)

Title: Showering in kitchen
Review: This is my third Brita in last one year. First two got the problem with indicator.However, this one is most annoying of all. It is showering in my kitchen. I have read for this particular issue in many reviews but never realize it could happen like this... I have to tighten the screw almost 2-3 times in a day. It's keep on coming off. It is the same tap and Filter unit type I am using since last five years however this one is coming off and again. Screw threads seem to be broken and water is sprinkling out. Last week I put my water bottle and went in the living room to check on our toddler, when I came back the whole kitchen was in a mess...I have to order for new one now as I have spare filters from Brita.

Title: Horrible
Review: I purchased one of these and entered a room that was 34 degrees Left the fluke 62 in there for a couple hours while I was in there. Four separate thermometers in various locations all read 36 and the flue checks the same area's at between 22 and 28. I haul produce and I I had relied on this it could possible cost me several hundred or thousand dollars in damages. 34 is cold, 28 is froze. This variance is unacceptable. When I showed the person running the warehouse he laughed at me and offered me a look in a drawer. He pulled it open and there was 5 of the same exact things. He told me they are a joke and that I wasted my money. It may be great at 500 degrees but at or near freezing it's useless.

Review: I bought this tea at an Asian market here in town. the box looks the same but the tea was horrible. It doesn't look like little green balls of tea leaves, it looks almost black. No tight little balls, the leaves expanded a little bit when in the water, there are tons of stems just thrown in there. It looks like shredded little leaves and stems. The tea turned out yellowish brown. I can stand anything just about anything so this was drinkable, but the quality was terrible. I don't know if this is how the brand always comes or if there was a problem with mine.

Title: Worked fine for a few months, now nothing. no lights no power.
Review: I am on the internet searching for a way to repair this oven, and the first link that came up was amazon, so I thought I would put my 2 cents in. We got it for a disabled friend of ours and it worked fine for awhile, but one day it just stopped. No lights, no heat, nothing. Seems to be fairly common with this oven.We selected this oven because the build quality felt solid and the design and styling was good. I would be wary of this model. The funny thing is there is really nothing to break in a toaster. I mean the moving parts (dials, trays, etc) all work fine still. The rest is solid state and should last 20 years. So much for that idea.

Title: 2 hours long and 40 minutes of dialogue. Seriously.
Review: This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The plot just never comes together (apes discover monolith, man discovers monolith, computer goes crazy, man discovers bedroom on the other side of the universe). What is the monolith anyway? And just why did Hal go crazy? I give this movie three stars because Hal is a great bad guy, and I love the scene where he sings ""Daisy"". Very cool special effects, esspecially that psychaelic nebula. Other than those few points, Stanely Kubrick is a sick man. Just watch A Clockwork Orange and The Shining to find out why.

Title: This Movie was AWFUL
Review: I can't remember being so disappointed in a gay/lesbian movie. The DVD package was really good, and that's what attracted me to the film even though I knew nothing about it. But when I watched it, I found that I was laughing out loud - not at the film itself (which tries to be a quirky dramedy), but because it was so earthshatteringly awful. The acting was bad, the script was worse, and the direction was terrible, as was the music. The only reason I kept watching it was to see just how much worse it could get, and in that respect it didn't disappoint me. What a gross, gross movie.

The only reason I kept watching it was to see just how much worse it could get, and in that respect it didn't disappoint me. What a gross, gross movie.

Title: Does not clump
Review: This litter does not clump. When I scoop out the urine clumps, the entire clump falls apart. My cat's litter box ends up dirty the first day I change his litter. Also, odor control is worthless since urine clumps fall apart. After a few days the litter box stinks. I will move on to another brand.

Title: A Personal Voice
Review: What I liked most about this book was Segovia's own personal voice showing through. It is, indeed, a very subjective self-portrait that romanticizes just about everything, but that's what I like about Segovia and the music he played! The book is about his life viewed through his own eyes and I appreciated the intimacy opened up to me. There are other works out there about Segovia that are more erudite, accurate, and objective but there's a real pleasure in reading this one.

Title: This book is useless
Review: This book is useless. I am an independent producer, and I found out the hard way that no financier wants to look at a business plan. If they are in the business they want to see a script and maybe, a budget. If they are not in the business, they want to see LLC documents. See The Biz, Schuyler M. Moore, Silman-James Press, Beverly Hills, 2002.

Title: Bad buttons
Review: Killer shirt, dude! High quality material, outstanding graphics. The buttons are super cool, too! Thick, round and chrome with flames painted(?) on! But...the thread holding the buttons on is a weak spot. (on mine, anyway) Several of the buttons have only one thread holding them on and the others aren't much better. One button is sewed on properly (in my non-seamstress opinion). I plan on taking it somewhere to have someone re-attach the buttons, and then plan on wearing it out. Literally! In both senses!

Review: The madcatz dance pad is not a very good product. The buttons are small and too close together, and the design is just horrible. What was Madcatz thinking?The response on the pad is ok, about what you'd expect from 3rd party products, but there are better 3rd party products out there. The buttons don't register sometimes and you'll find that they get stuck after playing for a while.All in all, this pad isn't really worth the price and you're much better off sticking with dance pads made by Konami and RedOctane.

Review: Everyone who knows John Hammond's music knows that he only does covers of famous blues standards and his singing, harmonica and guitar playing are always excellent-those are known quantities, and this re-release of a 60's album is no exception. But prospective buyers should know that there is only 29 minutes of music here. So, if you're new to John's music, you should consider his Greatest Hits instead which has over 70 minutes of blues covers. But if you're a collector, you'll buy this no matter what.

Review: Obviously this is a good book that keeps your attention like no other. & I have to add (like all of the other reviews) that the book had a large amount of grammatical errors but It was expected because I read some of the reviews before I read the book..........On another note I loved my home girl Keisha (she's was my fav character) even though she messed up she was a good person unlike Epiphany & Shana (but that's just my opinion). Over all the book is a great read that you'll fly through. Be sure to buy Sheisty & Still Sheisty part 2 at the same time(They're like kool aid and water you can't have one without the other) lol. The book is full of drama, love, and heart break that'll have you on the edge of your seat and a surprise ending that made me shed a couple tears.

Title: Thin and Loud, but Warm
Review: We were pretty disappointed in this item. Somehow, we trusted the color in the title ""teal"" as opposed to the color in the picture, which is a sort of rusted copper. The actual color is basically just like it looks in the picture but it is certainly not teal! Anyway, that was my bad for not believing the pic but the real reason we don't give it a good rating is because it is VERY thin and every time it moves, it sounds like a sleeping bag ... loud! It also constantly slips off of our bed, just like a sleeping bag would. The only redeeming quality - and the reason it gets two stars instead of one - is that it is pretty warm. I wouldn't buy it again, but at the price we paid ($30-ish) I wouldn't return it either. It will be nice for guests or as an emergency backup for cold weather.

The actual color is basically just like it looks in the picture but it is certainly not teal! Anyway, that was my bad for not believing the pic but the real reason we don't give it a good rating is because it is VERY thin and every time it moves, it sounds like a sleeping bag ... loud! It also constantly slips off of our bed, just like a sleeping bag would. The only redeeming quality - and the reason it gets two stars instead of one - is that it is pretty warm. I wouldn't buy it again, but at the price we paid ($30-ish) I wouldn't return it either. It will be nice for guests or as an emergency backup for cold weather.

Title: It Broke!
Review: This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff. However, after a few weeks of use it broke. It over-heated and then the off switch wouldn't work, so whenever it was plugged in, it was on! Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!

Title: Inaccuracy Kills Book
Review: Pardon my diatribe, but this book is the worst historical fiction ever written. Anyone even vaguely familiar with Poe's life with be appalled at the grossly negligent treatment of him as a drunk without a single moral in his being. Avi can't ever seem to hold a thought together, and relies heavily on the descriptions of Poe, appearing every other page, emptying a bottle. ""Poe"" in this book should not be confused with the real Poe. And I suggest for better reading to check out something written BY Poe.

Title: Sony digital 8/hi8/std8mm Walkman
Review: May be the last of its type to play both analog 8 and digital 8. Have been told Sony's newer digital8 camcorders are not backward compatible! Only drawback to this item (our business now has 4 of them) is that as they age, the circuit boards start to give the wrong instructions, i.e., our oldest model will often go into record mode when hitting ""play."" Suggest you always close record tab (why did Sony reverse the record tab procedure that other tape formats use????) before hitting play and the problem will not occur. This has been a vital item for our video transfer business, but not necessarily an item the average consumer needs.

Title: 2-1/2-Year-Old Loves It
Review: Our 2-1/2-year old son loves this toy. He loves bouncing around the house and quickly mastered it. It's a little small for him, but he's near the maxiumum age and he's also big for his size. The design is really cute. He loves talking to it, and keeps it near his bed at night. The construction is very durable (at least the membrane is very thick and appears nearly puncture proof).

Title: Ron Jeremy contines to grasp for mainstream acceptance
Review: Having been interested in the adult film business since the late 70's I was hoping for a look behind the curtain from someone who been a primary in the industry for nearly 30 years. What I found instead was Ron Jeremy explaining how he's been cut out of mainstream movies, lots of name dropping(celebrities I have known), some personal history, and not very much about the adult film industry.Jeremy seems to be a really nice guy who's been lead by his d**k for most of his life. His longevity in the industry is not that big a deal, men who can perform on cue last forever in porn, it's the women who get chewed up and spit out in a couple of years.I bought the book on a cut out rack for under 4 bucks. At that price it was worth the money. Ron Jeremy, in my opinion, missed a chance to write what could have been a really interesting goo on the porn industry.

Title: Second damaged shipment from Amazon
Review: Logitech X-540 5.1 Speaker SystemThis is the second time that I'll be sending the X-540 speakers back. The first time, parts were clearly rattling around in the subwoofer. I suspect that the damage occured in transit as the packaging wasn't what you would call robust. The books that Amazon ships are much better protected.Anyhow, I shipped that set back and requested a replacement set which just arrived. With the same damage to the subwoofer! That indicates to me that the build quality of the subwoofer could be a lot more robust even with the sparse packaging.I'll shop for a different product, probably from a box store as Amazon haven't mastered shipping these things!

Title: No menu!
Review: This DVD has no menu! As an artist and an art teacher, I purchased it with a genuine interest in enjoying by video the techniques of the Old Masters. The first section starts out with the very basics in shapes and shadows. The artist then moves on to figure drawing. If I want to review a section at a time, the only way to do it is to start at the beginning and fast forward until I hopefully arrive near where I want to be. It is also distracting to see the artist's arm come in front of the camera, plus he rambles. His drawings are well presented, but the video is poorly created.

Title: A sobering documentary
Review: Bowling for columbine is another proof of micheal moore's talent in filmaking. The film is an interesting and sobering look at gun control and the state of our society. Moore manages to provoke alot of thought throughout the film on the way the United States is as a society and how we love our guns. The film manages to be very interesting and at times funny but it does not stray away from the sobering truth of the chaotic state of gun crime in the US. The film may not be as gripping as other micheal moore films such as Farhenheit 9/11 but it certainly comes close.

Review: I liked this book. It has a cute story line and a happy ending. It is about a couple that had agreed they would not have children but one changed their mind after marriage. This change of heart was not felt by the other and resulted in a divorce. It shows how they go their different directions but still feel love for their former spouse. However, they start to move on with their lives but always doubt their decision to split up. I won't ruin the ending.

Review: It's a dense and fun work in a very interesting and important topic. It was my first book on law&economics, and I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend it especially for those who love economics--you will learn fascinating insights. The chapters on tort and criminal law were my favorites. David Friedman is a great teacher, in print or talk (if you haven't seen him speak, don't miss a chance).

Title: Enlightening, Fun & Important Read
Review: It's a dense and fun work in a very interesting and important topic. It was my first book on law&economics, and I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend it especially for those who love economics--you will learn fascinating insights. The chapters on tort and criminal law were my favorites. David Friedman is a great teacher, in print or talk (if you haven't seen him speak, don't miss a chance).

Title: theres a boy in the grils bathroom
Review: There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom This book is about a boy named Bradley. He had a sister named Claudia. At the beginning of the story Bradley is a lot of trouble in school and pretends to be more tough than he is. He kept his desk a mess with waded up papers and other junk. He did not do his homework and in class he daydreamed and played with the stuff in his desk. I think he was in the fourth grade. One day a new boy came to their fourth grade class. His name was Jeff. One day he made a mistake and went to the girls bathroom. Near the end Bradley decided he wanted to be good in school. I really like this book. I think this book would be good for teenagers. I hope that others who read this book like it. Rating five stars

Title: Snooze
Review: I love Stephanie Laurens and have read every single book she's put out. This one, however, was a big disappointment. There didn't seem to be a plot. She wants to marry him, he wants to marry her. She wants to wait until after the Little Season. He agrees. That's it. They go to parties and he's proud of the way she handles herself, she feels she can make him a good wife and at the end, they're in love. I just saved you reading the book, aren't I helpful?But please, read all of her other books!!
