1,Great,"This was a great children's book. Good book for young children, and children up to preteen . Good for them to read by them selves or to be read to them."
0,waste of money,"i bought these b/c my kids have both had febrile seizures and i am paranoid about fevers. so last week my 1 year old was sick and i put these stickers on both kids and each kid registered around 97 degrees for the 2 days straight. i know b/c i was doing rectal temps too that my son's reached over 101 at one point and these things never reflected a fever. not only a waste of money but i thnk these are SCARY b/c had i relied on them i never would have treated the fevers and they might have had more seizures. this product says on side ""hospital grade"" but i find this impossible to believe. i am going to try to get a refund b/c this product was so HORRIBLE."
0,Hmmm,"To me this is kind of a 'duh' book. Of course marketing targets our kids, and of course if greatly influences them. Nothing new. But if it opens people's eyes that did not yet realize this, and especially if it changes their attitudes towards children and television/videos...then great-- it should be read."
0,Review from the Synthesis,"The second album from grunge-era supergroup Audioslave plays out more like a boring `90s alt-rock mixtape than anything else. It's sad that a talented band like Rage Against the Machine has to play second fiddle to Chris Cornell's ridiculous growls and Jesus Christ posing. Honestly, it sounds like Tom Morello isn't even trying anymore as he strums his guitar, rewrites his past riffs and dicks around on his diverse collection of effects pedals. These guys have just done it so many times over again, it's now become unwelcome nostalgia. They prove this with the album's first radio-ready single, ""Be Yourself."" C'mon, it sounds like Cornell is taking songwriting lessons from Raffi as he sings ""be yourself is all that you can do."" Sorry, it's not going to work this time around.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"
1,Fantastic hit for New Years,This is by far one of the best singles of the year. I first heard the it in September and I've been listening to it ever since. The lyrics are very uplifting and in her brilliant style Whitney hits every note crisply and perfectly. The only negative I would say about this version of the single is it doesn't have the longer club mixes on it. The maxi-single has a 12+ minute club version of the Jonathan Peter's mix and the Thunderpuss 2000 mix on it. But even this version is still well worth buying. This is a perfect song to help you celebrate the new millennium this New Years so make it into your millennium theme!
1,Superb,"I needed a book for my vacation this past week, and I picked the perfect one. This book is perfectly written by Dave Eggers and brings the story of Valentino Achak Deng - one of the ""Lost Boys of Sudan."" From seven years old until the recent past you follow his journey from his war torn country to his life in a refugee camp, ultimately ending with his relocation into Atlanta.This book blew me away. The first person account of what it was like for these boys who avoided armies, lions, famine and more to make it across the border of Sudan to Ethiopia and then eventually to Kenya. This book opened my eyes up in many ways to the plight of refugees around the world. Fantastic book. JVD"
0,Breadman Ultimate Plus basket issues,"Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection BreadmakerBreadman Ultimate Plus is a good machine; however, after having mine for only two years, the basket broke while making jam. That wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I now have jam all through the inside of my Breadman. The mechanism on which the paddle sits simply came apart in the middle of the jam cycle. Now I have no bread machine. This is disappointing since the machine itself was fine before the basket broke."
0,Not very realistic,"We would have a problem applying some of the heavy techniques in this book for our moderately out-of-control kids. I think this is a good book for those with seriously out of control teenagers. However for both the serious and less serious cases, some of the recommendations in the book are just too unrealistic, and a little repetitive."
1,Great home workout equipment,Easy to use. Comes with DVDs and a list of exercises which were very helpful. Great addition to my home gym!
1,Tales Have Good Surprise Endings,"I ended up liking this DVD because each story have a surprise ending that makes the story satisfying and suspense along the way was worth it. Victoria Principal looks fabulous, for someone not in her 20s or 30s (though I don't know how old she's here), and I had hoped to see some nudity but there wasn't any. But she did pretty good being leading role in each tale."
1,Refreshing perspective on learning,"As a teacher at a private school and a homeschooling mom, this book gave me a refreshing perspective on education and learning - both at a structured school and at home. The philosophy of John Holt was what I have read about from ""unschoolers"". I think it is important to consider whether we are motivating our children to learn or teaching them to spit back what we think is important. This book gave me much food for thought in that area."
1,Excellent MIddle School World History Resource: Greek Philosophy,"""Wise Guy: The Life and Philosophy of Socrates"" by M.D. Usher is an excellent resource book for middle schoolers taking a world history class. Our standards require students to describe the key figures and major beliefs of HInduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Greek philosophy.... This book simplifies the philosophy of Socrates for our 6th graders. The illustrations by William Bramhall further help the students grasp the information - especially our ELL learners who benefit from the colorful visuals that bring the child right to the agora in ancient Athens where they can see Athenians discussing life's tough topics including , justice, right and wrong, wisdom, courage, beauty, love....""All I know is that I know nothing"" - Socrates"
0,"Dribble cup, anyone?","This was pretty disappointing. First of all, it's pretty big around. Not easy to lift with one hand when it's full of ice and water. So I MacGyver'd a handle out of the included nylon strap. Eh, it works. But when I tilt it up to sip from it, it tends to dribble several drops down my shirt, especially when it's full.I bought this Igloo cooler in hopes that the insulation would keep my icewater icy, but it doesn't keep things cool any more than the cheap, single-walled, plastic water-bottle it was meant to replace. At least that thing was taller and thinner, which made it easier to hold onto.The nice thing is that it's big enough around to put handfuls of ice into when the lid's off, which is one of the main reasons I bought it. Otherwise, kinda lame. I expected more from Igloo."
1,Excellent and Informative!,"I just loved it, as this film gives you so much more insight about yoga and where it comes from. Those practising yoga should def. watch ORIGINS OF YOGA. That does not mean that you have to be into the spiritual part about yoga. It's just great to see how the ""true"" Yogis live and where it all began. I can't wait for more films like this. I already saw 'Naked In Ashes' by Paula Fouce and it is outstanding, and I hope that it will be available on DVD soon."
0,The Fly (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)I,I bought a used-very good copy from HiddenRiches?. I didn't know the case was going to be cracked!!!!!! I guess my opinion of very-good and there's is different.
1,Pricey but for good reason,"Perfect for my wife and me. Holds a lot, allows good air circulation for air-drying, and easy to keep clean. Tried cheaper one-piece dish racks but they are very inferior."
0,Hookless and Uninspired Effort,"Whenever an editorial review like the one above says an album is good...run! It's usually the exact opposite. Case in point, Ozzy's newest album is drab, dry, and uninspired to a t. No hits here."
0,Never Received,"I was looking forward to this magazine. However, it is well past the date I was given for delivery and I still have not received it."
0,DISSAPOINTED! Maybe mine is expired...,"This is my first time ever using this product so I didn't know what to expect. I HATE it!. My hands do not feel anywhere near clean after using it, I can eat a meal, then use this product and my hands STILL smell like food. When I pump the foam into my hand, I have to quickly rub it into my hands before it drips down my wrist or through my fingers; I have to ""catch it"" as it's dripping down my wrist, no time to even put the cap back on. When I rub it in my hands, it feels very slick, like I'm rubbing in water. I've used foam sanitizer before and they were just that, FOAM, not liquid. So I am VERY dissatisfied and I will NEVER buy this again. I wish I had used it prior to purchasing so I would have known how it was suppose to be. And if this IS how it is suppose to be, then I would have never bought it. Unfortunately I have a case (6 bottles) of this crap. And 4 out of the 6 (that I've tried) are watered down drippy foam."
1,Interesting read,"I, too, remember the Bette Davis/Charles Boyer film fondly and was glad to find this novel so many years later. I have to agree with others that the second half of the book lacks the compelling interest of the first; Rachel Field was writing about her own family in the latter, and she would naturally be just as interested in it as she was Henriette's life in Paris. I enjoyed the look at New York in the mid-nineteenth century, but the second half of the book just wasn't as compelling. If it had been, I would have given this one five stars. Still, anyone who enjoys historical fiction laced with a bit of romance (not much romance, and somewhat old-fashioned, but sweet) will find much to appreciate in this book."
0,Definitely NOT Jerry Butler at his best,"Sorry Bradley Briggs, that's definitely not Jerry Butler at his best! It seems by 1980 Jerry Butler lost the sparkle and funk of his 1976 ""Love's on the Menu"" album and the fabulous groove on his joint album with Thelma Houston. Once you experienced these, it's hard to settle for anything less. I am confident in his huge catalogue there are some more pearls like these.I wish I knew them all and they were not out of print..."
1,christmas cottage,"my husband loves this movie. it is definatley for all ages, nothing to worry about the kids seeing, or swear words."
0,"voice has amazing potential, but lacks maturity","I bought this because I had only heard a snipet of ""Don't know why"" and was captivated by Jones' voice. Unfortunately, once I listened to the CD, there was nothing holding me there. The music is flat and has no lasting holding power. I look forward to future Jones' albums, but this one is going in the bin."
0,non sense,"like the ""teen"" one. i was pressure into buying this book, knowing it will not work, because every kid is different."
0,Weird,"I bought this book after the author was awarded the Nobel prize this year for his literary work. The book is definitely different... fantasy cannibalism in communist China appears to be the main focus of the book. The translation is hard to follow, and the Kindle edition contained a number of misspelled or omitted words. Overall, I do not think this book is worth an average person's limited ""reading"" time."
1,I LUV LOTR!,"I am a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, Ive watched the movie 20 times (date today, 9/12. I luv legolas!) and the first time I saw it, I thought: this move would make a great game! well, from all the reviews, It's lived up to that. I for one will probably play as legolas, since he can fire arrows about two or three times a second, but with this game, you can't win by pushing the same buttons repeatedly. You need to do combos of hits and different combinations, or the enemy will catch on to what you're doing. Also, don't think that the troll in Balin's toom is the only one in the game. They can pop up anywhere. I mean ANYWHERE. The game developers said that themselves. Just don't turn your back on the screen, and you'll be fine. :D"
0,Out of date and incomplete,"Honestly, this book is pretty poorly made in comparison to the later edition called Dark Ages Vampire. The art is sketchy, and lots of the disciplines are too vague. I could rant on endlessly about it in detail, but it would be much easier just to get the 2nd edition. The only thing I found useful (and yes, I have both versions, and every Vampire book ever made by White Wolf including the exotic ones most will never hear about) in this book that the new edition didn't cover is a price list for weapons and armor, using Resource dots."
0,Product Defective,"While priced right and shipping was exceptional, the life of the product was very short. Typical lifespan on a bulb like this has lasted me a year. This died in 5 weeks of minimal use. Product returned."
1,#2 IN WIND RIVER RESERVATION SERIES,"This was one of the earlier books in the Wind River Reservation series. Somehow, I missed reading it years ago when I read the rest of the series. Father John and Vicky Holden are very prominent in the entire series. This time out, the mission is up for sale and there is EVIL afoot. Good story."
1,Excellent.,"I strongly recommend this book. It is even-handed in its approach, admitting what we can and cannot know from natural law alone. And you can safely disregard the Publisher's Weekly commentary, particularly the comment regarding utilitarianism, as it IS in fact fairly dealt with (despite not being the primary subject of this book). For a more thorough critique of utilitarianism, see the first part of Love and Responsibility, by Karol Wojtyla."
1,Perfect fit,I bought these shoes before and they served me well for over a year. They fit well and needs very little break in. Very comfortable.
0,PLO Propaganda anti-semitic film,"Incredible! the rewritting of the real story in this film is incredibly crafty, a masterpiece of deceit, propaganda and corruption."
1,Weller PTA8 Soldering tip,Good temperature control in a reasonably priced tip. Easy to replace. Expect to replace the tip about every three to six hours of soldering.
1,I like his style.,I got this DVD for my boyfriend last year for Christmas. We seen his show on TV and thought it was hilarious. My boyfriend still watches it.
0,too mellow for my 2 1/2 yr old,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson was going on a cross country car trip and I though this would show him some of the things he'd see along the way. he has a car DVD player so I thought he could watch it while driving. He was totally bored with the DVD and walked away after only a few minutes. It is a very mellow tape, perhaps he is used to something a little more loud and active. Anyways, a dud for us."
0,Big but underpowered,It was mismanufactured and sat out of square on the sled. Then the degree angle levers were misaligned;you could not tighten them as they struck the sled. I found that the big hole in the sled makes it hard to use when starting cutting a beam. The power is not alot different than my 7 1/4 Bosch circulat saw. You have to be really careful to pry away the cut off as the saw binds and stops.The guard lever needs to be longer as NORMAL fingers cant hold it up when starting the cut.I did not find it all that heavy.
0,"speaker issues, battery issues, not worth it","The speaker for the speakerphone is nice and loud, but every once in a while it fades in and out. After a year, the battery is only lasting 20 minutes before the phone dies."
1,House of Love (import),Though not her best work this is a must have album if your a fan of Amy's. This album is complete with bonus tracks (remix of Say You'll Be Mine and Politics Of Kissing) but are well worth the extra money you have to pay for it. So even if you already have the US version buy this one also. Also check out Lead Me On and Behind the Eyes.
0,A Real Disappointment,Naked Prey & Hidden Prey marked the beginning of the end of the Lucas Davenport that we all came to know & love. In Broken Prey he's so domesticated he's barely recgonizable and with the exception of Sloan and Ellie all the characters with whom Lucas interacted are missing. Also missing is the insight into the mind of the killer that was so much a part of the other books. Instead of the usual page turner this plot seemed contrived & the identity of the killer was right out of left field. This new Lucas is a mere shadow of his old self and that doesn't bode well for any future Prey books - don't know how he could manage it but I hope Sanford can either bring back to old Lucas or introduces a new character just as interesting to replace him.
1,Still Mostly Enjoyable,"We've made it up to ""Q"" and the word this time is ""Quicksilver."" That, and Max, as the Max character is very visible in this book.The plot in this book focuses around Temple getting a major new PR assignment at the New Millennium Hotel. A major exhibition is there featuring valuable Russian treasures, the most major bieng a priceless Czar Alexander scepter. It seems that it's a target for theft, but there are those that have more than theft on their minds.Also featured pretty heavily in this book are Shangri-La and her ""poisonous Siamese cat, Hyacinth. And the plot with Matt Devine is really heating up as well.I agree that some elements of the story are becoming a bit soap-operaish and I really didn't think much of the last book in the series. Still, I found this one a reasonably decent read and so I'll be continuing with the series. ""Cat on a Red Romp"" maybe? :)"
0,Feh!,"Absolutely horrible. Both fans of the series and the elder Herbert's memory would have been better served by an edited version of the latter's notebooks, not this cheap tripe. This is the only prequel I have read (I forced myself to finish it), and the only one I will.Don't waste your money. Or your time: if offered it for free, politely decline. Ghastly."
0,Many problems,"I've owned this watch (the black one) for about a year now. I did not purchase the foot pod accessory.The watch has on 4 occaisions gone 'all black' lighting up every pixel on the face. When this happens you have to do a 'reboot' holding all 4 buttons down simultaneously until the watch resets. Of course all your data needs to be reentered.THe watch has also mysteriously reset to March 24, 2005 on 4 or 5 occaisions (10am I think). The time and date are all messed up but it keeps your personal info.The problem appears to be on the RS200 only. Check out the posts on runnersworld for many, many more disatisfied customers before making a decision on this watch."
0,MIND-readers,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. I began reading this book thinking surely an award winner must be great, and ended up wondering if I'd missed something along the way. Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book, the reader is tossed into confusion. The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as critic's recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt."
0,Crappy Heroine,"Gypsy Lover has a romantic sexy hero. Unfortunately, the heroine is predjudiced against gypsies - even after the hero has rocked her world three times! Until almost the last 1/3 of the book, she thinks that Dante is beneath her and can't marry him. But that doesn't stop her from getting it on with him. The sex scenes were pretty hot, too bad it wasn't with another female. I would not bother to buy this book - check it out at the library. A better book from Connie Mason is the Rogue and the Hellion."
0,Great Theory Poorly Described and Lacking,"The concept of UML is a great one and while the authors are great, the book is not. Like the Strousoup C++ it stinks. Just because they developed the idea doesn't mean they can write. The books reads like an Academic book. They try to counteract this with a catchy example at the beginning of each chapter, but fail to explain UML detail in any breadth. At the end of the book I am left feeling like UML is great, but I'm tired, frustrated, and am not quite clear how to use it in any applications -- only that I should."
0,Duraline is not Duable,"I'm looking for an alternative this Homelite DuraLine trim line. These never seem to last very long. I only spend about 8 minutes trimming around stone walls, a concrete patio and wire mesh fence. Although I try to keep the line off the stone and concrete, this line only lasts for 2 trimmings before gets pretty worn down and breaks. It always breaks off before it wears all the way down. Am I expecting too much?"
1,GREAT AFRICAN AMERICAN BARBIE DOLL,ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN AMERICAN QUEEN BARBIE DOLLS.GREAT FOR THE COLLECTOR OR FOR YOUR CHILDRENS PLEASURE.GREAT FOR CHRISTMAS.
0,People Training for Dogs,"This is an absolute waste of money, just more hagiography for Cesar. His TV series is amusing and informative, but this dvd is a rip off."
1,Best Pan I Own!,"I love this pan! It is the best pan I've ever owned. My other pans are stainless steel but can't hold a candle to this one. It makes the best omelets and is the best nonstick pan. Just make sure your pan is well heated before cooking and follow the care instructions. You will have no problem. Before I bought this pan I really didn't know anything about them. I didn't know a seasoned pan from an unseasoned pan. There is no need to season this pan as I have read many people do. It works great just as it is right out the box. For those of you who are contemplating buying this pan, just buy it and I guarantee you'll love it!"
1,Its real but OLD..,"I believe the fragrance you purchase from Amazon or other outside companies are genuine. The only real concern is the shelf life. I have a friend who works for Macy's and she was explaining to me that many of those colognes, perfumes or scents are outdated or aged really well. So you might end up with a bottle or batch that was produced in 2005 and its on sale now in the year 2012. Cologne life span is usually 3 to 5 years. Many last longer depending on what the make up is."
1,Up all Night,This was an absolutely fantastic book. Opened it in the evening and couldn't put it down through the early hours of the next morning. Great characters! Original ideas! I wish the political concepts could be implemented for real. An outstanding and explosive conclusion. Recommend to everyone.
0,NOT a WEBKINZ,"I am upset because I wanted to purchase a Webkinz unicorn and this came up as a webkinz brand because it is tagged as such with Amazon. It is not Webkinz! It is Russ brand. You can go online with this in a manner similar to Webkinz but only on the Russ website. Cute unicorn, but not the one that my daughter had requested. I have also had difficulty returning to Amazon because although they managed to send me this request for a review, they don't seem to be able to find a record of my purchase so I can return it. Sign me very disappointed in Amazon for this one!"
0,Ideological theory of history -- and extremely repetitious,"Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war. With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance. Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism. He should be writing political speeches, not history. His theories are just plain silly.If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting."
0,Poor Fit,I am a larger male who bought this product to help with support for back pain. The sides are contoured and were too narrow to fit my body comfortably. Did not use as a result.The vendor was prompt in delivery and billing.
1,History and love: great combination,"Amin Maalouf did a very fine job in the formation of this novel, when combining the fiction with the hisctorical realities. This novel tells about a great love of Omar Khayyam, and concludes with the titanic accident. A great historical persfective, huh?It also includes some rubai's of Omar Khayyam, in which he opposes the GOD's nature, and GOD's laws, which I found to be really great...I strongly recommend this book, to learn something about Omar Khayyam, a small and msyterious history of the middle east, and to have a great time... The only bad thing is you will finish reading it not more than one night, not beacuse it is short but you can not stop reading it..."
1,Very Cool!,"This floating cooler is actually better than expected! It is good quality and I like the handy carrying case. I spent a while comparing different floating coolers and didn't like the look of some of the others. I know a bit silly, but I wanted a plain color not a lot of advertising. The vinyl is a good quality too."
1,Easy to install works great.,Length:: 3:31 MinsWatch video on Kidde 1279-9999 and Kidde 0919-9999 for complete installation instructions.
0,Could be better... much better...,"Now, don't take offence here, but this album did nothing for me. The songs all sounded more or less alike; the band didn't branch out into other styles of singing. Also, truth be told, they do sound like girls. I'm not saying this to insult them. It's just the way it is. The album was full of meaningless pop songs - I doubt if Dream Street actually wrote their own songs (don't hold me to that, though). One thing I will give them though: I've read that all or most of them had Broadway backgrounds before they started singing in a band. So, hey, at least they really can sing. All in all, Dream Street is just another boy band with catchy songs that are bound to get stuck in your head. However, I think pre-teens who are just getting into the music scene might enjoy this CD and will also like the band members, who are still in high school. Otherwise, I'd advise you to look elsewhere for good music."
1,I thought this book was great.,"I totally felt like I was a part of this book when I was reading it. At times, it could have gone a little faster, but it was altogether a well-written book. The way the author wrote the book made you understand exactly how the characters looked and felt at the various parts of the book.What's good about it is that it's pretty fast-paced."
1,Great product at great price,The seat covers came exactly as described and at a great price! Just what I was looking for! Very happy with my purchase!
0,Is it time for an Old Master to retire?,When I first was introduced to Ludlum many years ago I devoured and re-read many of his works. It is sad to say that this effort is the latest in a string of 3-4 of very disappointing efforts. I will find it as hard to justify reading his next novel as I will in turning away from it.
0,Disappointing at Best,"In conducting my own sociological research and as a former female Marine, I eagerly sought out this book, hoping for real information about the current status and experiences of women in the U.S. military. What I found, however, was 370 pages of self-serving diary-type brooding, anecdotal ""evidence"" of rampant sexual predation by military males, and almost NO voices of the military women themselves. This book is disappointing at best. I found myself appalled by many things Ms. Solaro asserted and alternately laughing at other things that were simply preposterous. I suppose this book could be useful to give someone an extremely subjective view of women in the contemporary military; however, readers BEWARE that this is written by a journalist! Although, Ms. Solaro alludes to her credentialed education, I see very little evidence of an acceptable methodology nor support for her extrapolated conclusions. Readers should take this book with a heavy dose of skepticism."
1,Awsome!!!,This is probally the best of all of his albums. My favorite song would probally be superman.You should listen to it on the preview list and i think that you would agree with me that it is a good song. I would recomend this album to anyone who: 1) Is having problems with their life right now because he talks a lot about his life problems.2) Anyone who likes eminem because he is probally the best singer/songwriter i have ever heard3) Anyone who wants a change in their music and hasen't heard eminem yet.
1,Excellent Light Stand,"This stand is a very study stand that can take a lot of use and abuse. I use it inside and outside. The only slight down side is the overall length of the stand when it is collapsed for transport. I have a 42"" bag and it will not fit so I have to buy a longer bag if I want to transport it with my other equipment or just carry it separately which is not really a big deal. I would recommend this stand if you need the extra height."
1,A fresh understanding of Matthew's text,"Prof. Neyrey brings fresh insight to the text of Matthew using resources from otherwise ignored classical sources. With the tools of classical literature and social science criticism, Neyrey writes clearly, arguing cogently for Matthew as encomium literature. A must for every bookshelf."
1,A Fun Reference,"I bought this book because of the sibling name relationships the book offers. It lists possible sibling names for the names it defines, and it groups the names into classes and trends. It's a fun book to simply look up names in---it got 3 of my husband's sibling's names! I was pleased at how good her research was, and although I didn't intend to use it to name a child (more as a research tool for my students to use in a classroom project), I have loaned it to 2 separate families to help them with their own baby naming strategy. I highly recommend the book!"
1,Through A SUSPENSFUL BOOK!,This book (like other Lois Duncan novels) is one of the best books I have ever read. The other keeps you hooked in every second. read this book!!
0,Deserves a Couple of Negative Stars,"Look somewhere else for your strategy fix. I was desperate for something new and bought this game, even though I couldn't find any reviews of it. My money was wasted.So much is so very wrong with this game. For brevity I'll give one example: for your global empire, running in realtime, you have a jump-map of the world about the size of your thumbprint. You hear that there is an attack on, say Montreal, and you have to pick a point in the NW North America, about the size of the head of a thumbtack, click then hunt around for the frickin city you need to find. Then you have to jump to southern Europe and hunt for another city. It is exhausting and stupid - like many other features of this game."
1,very good electric lantern,I bought this as a replacement for the one I've used camping several times per summer for five years. The switch on my original one gave out. I use this one inside the tent.

0,very unhappy,"My husband ordered these batteries for me in December. I can not believe how poor the quality is. The batteries are either dead on arrival or only last 1-4 hrs. I did have a few that lasted 6 hrs. The exp date is Aug 2016. I have already gone through a box of 60 batteries and am on my second box. When I got my hearing aids in May, I bought a box of Rayovacs. Each battery lasted 3-4 days. Save your money and frustration and do not order iCell Tech 312 batteries. The only use for these batteries are the trash."
0,Don't fit like 511's,"Like other (negative) reviews, the jean color in the picture was different than what I received. The picture of the chain link color shows a blue pair of jeans but I received a gray pair. However, the label on the jeans do say chain link. I ordered a 28x30, like all my other Levi's 511 skinny pants but these didnt fit like them. They fit more like very skinny jeans, like the kind on the Miller Lite commercial. The waist size was correct and did fit like 28 should. Levi's is at fault for not keeping the all sizes at a standard. I will be returning them."
0,Manipulation of fact to support her preconceived thesis,"Ms. Blee has many flaws in her research, documentation, interpretation and conclusions. At worst this is a conscious manipulation of fact to support Ms. Blee's preconceived thesis. At best it is a work of pure fiction."
1,Already spellbound by this brilliant book,"I'm only halfway through this magnificent new novel from Jennifer Egan and I am so spellbound that I'm rationing my reading of it now. Twenty pages a day, no more. Well, except if there's a chapter that's almost done. Or if it's raining.What Egan has done is made the telling of the story almost as suspenseful as the plot. The succession of voices has its own mysterious chemistry as this tale of two cousins-bound by a shocking childhood betrayal- unfolds in a mythically mysterious setting somewhere in eastern europe.I don't want to 'tell' the plot for fear of spoiling it, but in fact, any competent telling would be as long as the book and I don't think this one is susceptible to spoilage. A simply brilliant book.Lynn Hoffmanauthor of bang-BANG forthcoming from Kunati andThe New Short Course in Wine from Prentice Hall."
1,Cyberpunk in a Society of Women,"Slow River"" is good. I particularly enjoyed the author's ability to turn a phrase. However, the story lacked ""closure"".In the story a young heiress is kidnapped and escapes into a cyberpunk netherworld. Here she hides-out looking to find herself.The tech is good, the prose is good, and the setting was noir and gritty. However, the story is a bit thin when it comes to Lore's family which features so prominently in the beginning and end. Lore's mother, and sisters are cyphers that come to figure too largely in the story.Finally, where did all the men and straight-het sex go? The novel seemed to exist in a society of women. The absence of male characters (except as evil doers) was a bit too obvious. This detracted from the reality of the story.By the way, I think the ""River"" is the Humber."
0,Well....... didn't meet expectations,"I thought this book would be more, or read like more, to me.... I ended up scanning some passages because of the telling of individuals' stories that permiate the book. I came away with a couple of things to think about, but on balance, I thought there was just too much ""filler"" and not enought ""there""..there. Good concepts, but not enough for a book..... and not so different than what others have proposed in other books. Just a different take. Would have made a nice pamphlet."
1,They're Pink & They Work,"These are well made. But seriously, I got them because they're pink! What fancy lady cook doesn't secretly delight in pink measuring cups?What else can I say:- Sturdy- Accurate measurements- Ring works again and again- Lovely Pink Color!"
0,too much talking; not enough instruction,"I purchased this video hoping it would help me with my coaching of two youth league teams. One 10-11 year olds; the other 12-13 year olds. I've been coaching several years with good success and thought Mr. Wooden's video would heighten my knowledge of the game and game preparation. Frankly, I am dissapointed at the long-on-talk short-on-skills development contained in it. Mr. Wooden goes on for long sections discussing tiresome aspects of the game...and the excessive length makes it useless for kids. It strains my attention span. The drills are one or two-on one; if I do these drills, I have eight other kids standing around bored. Good man, dated video style. p.s. The coach of Duke University (Mike K) has an excellent vido out for teaching kids although I can't find it on Amazon and someone borrowed mine. Help if you know how I can get it."
0,Historical background is very light,"I'm a history buff and enjoy the history behind different patterns. There is a fair amount in the book. Unfortunately, my expectations were set based on the local library having Levine's 4th edition. As an example, compare the jack knife sections and the descriptions on patterns. I assumed this book would be an update on values, but leave content intact. Instead, big chunks are missing. Blade is a fine magazine, but this book is a big disappointment."
0,Just Itching to Hear This,"I've always been a big fan of Neil Diamond. I look forward to his renewed career.Unfortunately, until this CD is re-released in a safe format, I won't be purchasing it. More generally, I won't be purchasing further Sony product because of the disregard that the company shows for its customers. Unless this album comes out soon without the dangerous software, I'll look for it on iTunes and will write a followup review."
1,The Opinions of Elizabeth & How to knit.,"No self-respecting knitter should be without this marvelous book in theircollection! Elizabeth's wonderful wit & humor are so refreshing! Her knowledge of knitting, her tips, & techniques are inspiring & stimulating to the newest knitter, & the most experienced ones. In today's knitting classes, her innovative designs, fashions, & techniques are still talked about, referred to, & passed on. Thankfully, we also have her unique style of writing to give us guidance -- videos to watch, & learn from. This is just a wonderful book to own!"
0,Great cast bogged down in sub &#65533;B&#65533; material.,"How can a movie with this cast, and directed by Barry Levinson, be so bad? I've never really listen to profession critics, so I rented this expecting a pretty good film. Boy, was I ever wrong. This film miss-fires on every level. I thought I was watching a 50s `B' film, and basically, I was. I won't go into the plot (there isn't any, at least any worth mentioning), but this film did have one thing I enjoyed, at that was seeing Peter Coyote. I was wondering what had happened to him. It's too bad his return had to be in this turkey. Between 1 and 10, ""Sphere"" gets a 4, and is lucky to get that."

1,Darth Maul Lightsaber,"This is a great lightsaber but just a few exeptions, first off when your doing some tricks and the lightsaber's ""Ignite"" button usually hits your fingers and it turns it off.Second the length of the blades for WAY too short and that makes it unreal but other than that its a great toy and fun to play with."

1,A Great Mix of New Material From Dwight Yoakam,"I can't think of a past CD that I have purchased where I have loved all the tracts contained in it as I do in this one. This CD ranges from emotional ballads to upbeat, fastly-paced songs. The vocals are excellent while delivering the lyrics, sometimes keeping one in suspense with a changing tempo. The instrumental portion and background vocals fit in perfectly. It's definitely my favorite."
1,LP or CD...a no-brainer choice!,"I first purchased this on CD and liked the songs despite the tinny sound quality. Yesterday I bought the LP in a used store and the difference is immediately clear. Frank Beard's drums are actual drums vice whatever they put on the CD. Now I know why that 1976 tour was THE SHOW to see back then. Easily one of their best albums and it should be heard on vinyl. Now, go get your LP!"
0,Very Disappointed,"Do.Not.Purchase. The plush cat bus that they send you looks nothing like the picture. It was terrible to think that they were charging about 20-something dollars for such a piece of trash.All the legs were simply a single piece of fabric with cotton shoved in at random intervals- making sudo legs that were fused together.The sewing was absolutely terrible- you can see places where the machine/person missed with cotton poking out of the plushThe dimensions were very misleading- while the description claims it is 7 inches long- it doesn't mention that it is about 3 inches tall.I have ordered both the catbus and gray totoro from this company- completely ripped off both times. If you want a good quality plush, shop from a Japanese website instead."
0,Disappointment,"Not being aware that Mr. Ludlum had passed away, I eagerly purchased this book. What a disappointment! It's a shame to carry on his name in this fashion.In my opinion, the book was quite amateurish, slow and wordy for wordiness' sake (case in point - the meeting in the airport with the guy using (too many!) fractured idioms, e.g., ""kill two fowl with one rock"", ""birds of the same plumage seek out one another's company"", ""all that coruscates (coruscates???) is not gold."") Also, as someone else mentioned, the editing seemed lacking (the gun that was seen beneath a bush, highly accessible, then later is was ""completely inaccessible"").I won't make the mistake again - there are much better choices around."

0,Zardoz Redux?,"Um... is it just me or did this storyline borrow HEAVILY from John Boorman's 1975 Zardoz starring Sean Connery in one of his early post-Bond movies? Similarities:* Isolated outpost created by scientists that is protected from ""nature""* People who live forever who are having mental issues (recycled clones in Flux)* Sterility issues in the population* A scientist manipulating the actions of an individual with a talent for extreme violence in an effort to take down the status quo (the old guy in the blimp thingy. In Zardoz it was a scientist in a flying stone idol (that looks remarkably like Janus) trying to find just the right guy (Connery - ""Seth"" if I recall correctly) among a bunch of savages to do the deed.I mean, it isn't an out and out rip off, but the story certainly seems to borrow heavily from Zardoz - also a very weird film that seems to lack cohesion."
0,It was repitious and boring.,The book has good points but unfortunantly it was very repitious. This entire book could have been finished in 2 chapters.
1,Deep in the Heart of the Beast,"I'm rereading Heart of the Beast because I tore through it too fast the first time to savor it fully. Told in first person, it's the story of hard-headed, vulnerable Iris Steele who's trying to run the family wheat farm/cattle ranch in Eastern Oregon and struggling against a natural world as ruthless as her kinfolk.The land itself is a major character, cherished and fought over for four generations. As Iris discovers how they got the land from the Nez Perce, who are suing her to get it back, her struggles to save it illuminate her understanding of her father, violent, driven Ike Steele, and her own nature.In a series of dramatic, wonderfully detailed scenes we are Iris delivering a calf, caught in a wildfire, connecting with her long-yearned-for lover, trying in a little twin-engine plane to rescue a wounded Indian on a reservation with no landing strip.This novel is one of those rare total immersion experiences. Not to be missed."
0,Liners never fit,"My cat used the box and it looks cute, however the special liners that are required for it never fit. We ended up throwing the liners away and just scrubbing the box when the litter got changed."
0,Not great,Not sure why this is getting such great reviews. The product is cheap with a tiny handle and think base.
1,Good but you have to learn it,Good results - but is a real camera not a point and shoot - put the effort in and it rewards. Don't use higher than iso 400
0,Easy times and happy people,"Wouldn't you like to have a whole month to vacation in Europe by a lake flirting with an attractive countryman? That is really all there is to this story, and yet it has a disceet charm which cannot be denied.I think everyone has somewhere inside a vision which equates roughly to this story. Would that we could all enjoy its charms every year of our lives."
1,My Immortal,"Two of the album's songs made it into the ""Daredevil"" soundtrack. A fairly uncommon result for a new band. While ""Bring me to Life"" got the play time, ""My Immortal"" is far more haunting and more enchanting. It's amazing that this was written prior to the movie, because it fits in so well with the scene following Electra dad's life. The whole CD is great !!"
0,Below average,"I go through iPod ear buds far too quickly and am always looking for affordable ones. This pair was affordable but sadly the sound quality just doesn't come close. To me they are little different from the dollar store ear buds.JVC Jelly (I think that's what they were called) were quite good and you could get them for $5-$6 at Ross. Now I'm in Canada with no Ross. Anyone have good, affordable ear bud suggestions in Canada?"
1,great resource,"This manual is an EXCELLENT resource for APA style. I'm a grad student was having trouble with term papers and APA format. It seemed like every website I checked had a different rule. This manual is recent, up-to-date, easy to use and relatively easy to understand (as easy as understanding APA could be). The table of contents and index are both very helpful in navigating through the manual. I highly recommend this spiral bound version, as it is good for staying open where you need it, especially when your hands are busy doing other things (like typing away at term papers). It is also a good resource for journal article/technical writing in general. It would be nice if it came with external tabs (even internal ones would be great), but it's not too hard to add your own."
1,"Keep It Up, Tim!","I love this cd! I have been listening to it steady since I bought it the other day. I feel this CD represents a lot of maturity in his singing. The ballads ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" and ""Please Remember Me"" are absolutely wonderful!"
0,"Warning, these decals will fall off!",These decals look great when you first put them on the tire. I bought 3 and after a few months two have fallen off during normal driving. Possibly try super gluing these to your wheel? I don't feel like these are worth the $11 I paid.
0,don't buy it,"It doesn't do anything that's promised in the description. Couldn't even handle cut dried apricots, that's been sitting in water for 2 hours (can you imagine how soft were they?)It says that it can turn chunky fruits, frozen ingredients and even ice into the smoothest purees, creamiest healthy fruit beverages and more ..goodluck with that! I am very dissapointed with this product."
0,These Headphones Aren't Worth The Buy!!,"These Headphones we're good, the plastic seems cheap but its okay, they're loud but not your adverage bass sounding headphones, I was okay about them until the left side of the headphones went out!! I Didn't even use them that much or often! And They Broke! Thanks For NOTHING Panasonic, i really wasted my money!"
1,I witnessed this concert live,"On March 29, 1959, I had my 15th birthday & as one of my presents my great-aunt took me to this concert. I was overawed by the presence of one of my favorite opera singers. This CD captures the true essence of that performance. It is great to relive one of the most vivid events in your life. The sound is very clean & realistic. The concert was partially sponsored by Steinway & Sons and state of the art recording techniques were employed. This recording is a good representation of what he really sounded like. It is truly an historic recording and should be purchased by anyone who loves Björling. He died about a year and a half later."
1,O.K. version,"I have read the Lombardo translation of the Iliad and its very well done, except he is in a league of giants; I think for the lyical aspect of Homer Pope is the best, and for the symplicity of the Epic, Lattimore and Fagels do a great job. I think if somebody want to enjoy the Iliad, Lombardo is a terrific starting point, but the others should not be forgoten. (Esp Pope: he is my favorite, I am VERY partial)."
1,"good, helpful entry into the topic","I bought this book for a class. Though a bit dated, it is very helpful. I recommend it for those who are serious about helping their organization one that learns."
0,pretty poor,"I am extremely dissapointed in these earbuds. I received them in late January and they were not working properly by early March. Even when they were working, the sound quality was mediocre at best and the earbuds continued to fall out of my ears. I have contacted JLabs to complain about the month and a half longevity of this crappy product, but they have not returned my email."
1,A good book if love Twin Peaks,"I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks, and this book gives you an insight on Laura's life, it explains a lot about KILLER BOB and why she died. I'd recommend it to a Twin Peaks fan. My friend read it without seeing Twin Peaks she said it was ok."
0,Not worth the money,"I have a dime size dent on my car's door (flat panel). Tried multiple times and it didn't do anything.On top of that, seller expects me to pay for shipping for return.Stay away!!"
1,"realistic, gut-wrenching, tight story with plenty of action","I picked up Keeper out of curiosity and was hooked from the first chapter. It read quickly, but not for lack of substance. The plot was put together well, leaving you guessing right up to the end. The characters, especially Kodiak, were not unbelievable supermen, and were susceptable to pain and anguish. Rucka's story of a young man doing an ugly job was a great one, and a great debut. It wasn't just a mystery/suspense story. It also handled an extremely sensitive issue with the professionalism of a seasoned author. I applaude him for that and rank him right up there with Robert Parker and Ross Macdonald. I am anxiously awaiting his next book, Finder, and hope for many more Atticus Kodiak novels"
0,"""Mauriat's Best ?","I was looking forward to receiving this album. Unfortunately the timeless classics ""Love Is Blue"" is not the original but an up tempo version and a lot of the other tunes are ""techno crap"" influenced. Why the heck doesn't it say NOT THE ORIGINAL recording.Extremely disappointing to me but probably manna from heaven for others."
0,"Nice Packaging, but Not Much Substance","I bought this package thinking that it would have some really good techniques on retouching wedding photos and when I got it, the book and DVD only covered basic Photoshop techniques that are applied to wedding photos. I would recommend this package to beginners, but for the mid to expert Photoshop users; I recommend passing on this."
1,A real look at real gang life,"Sanyika Shakur's depiction of his life as 'Monster' Kody Scott and his trasformation to avid black rights fighter is vivid, real and effective. His descriptions of street life in LA are appaling and force the reader to take a look at their own views of gangs and their members. While some of his descriptions of gang activities can be disturbing, there are effective in showing what it really means to be a gang member in LA. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in truly understanding gang life, its causes and its effects."
0,Very dark...depressing...questionable,"I found this book very dark and questionable. I was not sure what the message of the author was. I know there was one, but it was depressing."
1,Great Teapot,"I've made use of this every day since I got it. This same pot is $180 elsewhere, and it's just about worth that. If you're even reading this far, just buy it and enjoy your tea."
1,"""So Unsexy"" is on the cover, so where is it??!!!! Coulda been perfect!","I was so looking forward to this CD before it came out. It was SUPPOSED to have every one of my favorite Alanis songs on it. So where the heck is the superb track, ""So Unsexy""? It IS on the cover!!! Good collection, but NOT the IDEAL one I was looking forward to."
0,Didn't Sway Me,"Obviously this film was made to make people feel sympathy for the subjects. It was interesting to watch, but I don't feel any pity for these men. They were rescued by the US, given a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a great life, and they all just pissed it away. They admit that they never bothered becoming citizens. It just wasn't important to them. They break our laws, and then they are outraged when they are booted. If only we can exile all our criminals! One of them was especially obnoxious: Kim Ho Ma, a shiftless, wannabe gangsta. After being deported, he was lucky enough to land in a halfway house that gave him free room and board. All he did there was smoke, listen to rap, and play cards. How about helping out the old man mopping the floor at the very least? I could only roll my eyes as he preened and complained that he didn't fit in because he was raised in America. At the very end, all he had to say was F this and F that and F America. Good riddance."

0,Too many bugs.,I love the C&C series but this packaged version has way too many bugs in it which make some of the games unplayble.
1,his classic debut lp,"The debut lp from Cocoa Tea suggested great things to come for this now legendaty 80's star.Many of the tracks on this debut lp are condensed forms of dancehall favorites, such as ""I Lost my Sonja,"" ""Rockin'Dolly,"" ""Evening Time,"" and the title track. Too bad Tea's first major dancehall blowout, the classic ""Searching in the Hills,"" wasn't somehow put on this lp (maybe it will on a re-issue at some point), but no matter.This lp is a dancehall legend, and asserted Cocoa Tea into the pantheon of greats, where he still resides. Great effort."
1,Great music... unfortunately bad production.,"First I'd like to thank prodigy for making one of the most memorable and addictive albums of all time.However, the sound quality on this record is bad. NOW LOOK, If you listen to music on a regular stereo or regular $20 headphones you WILL NOT notice a difference- just go out and buy this album and DROOL. But if you are an audiophile like myself, with a truly hi fidelity stereo or great headphones (sennheiser or grado or etymotic) then this record is gonna make you sad. With SUCH potential it's a shame they didn't record this better.Oh well.p.s. SATANSATANSATAN"
0,great concepts awash in babble,"the same great motley investment lessons, but unfortunately awash in a sea of wordy babble and silliness. save yourself some money and download the free '13 steps' PDF from the motley fool website -- you'll get 80% of everything in this book, and you'll get in in 60 pages instead 300, for free! that last 20% you can find on the motley site anyways. i haven't read the other motley books but if you're heckbent to buy a book i've got to believe 'the MF investment guide' is better than this."
0,Weak compared to previous Best Of sets,There isn't much to say beyond that this set advertises over 30 full fights but that is simply untrue. On previous sets there were full fights that played as part of the feature montage in addition to several full bonus fights. I believe 2010 had 40+ full fights while this set only has around 5 full fights. It's a disappointing highlight reel from the year and many of the highlights aren't that great. I was upset with this compilation.
0,Hardly the best Fleming!,"I do not understand why this disc chooses to record the 'remote' Mozart arias, No. 1.Ms. Fleming failed to impress listeners as a Mozartian in this disc, No. 2.A singer of her reputation should be more discerning in her discography.Not that the rarer or earlier Mozart is any less good than Cosi fan tutte or Don Giovanni.But if you have listened to recordings of all Mozart's earlier opera (to which I have), you would be bound to admit that Ms. Fleming did not fare well in those pieces she had chosen here. And even in her Donna Elvira on this disc, she is not in best form.Mozart is not an easy composer to handle. The timbre of Fleming does not sit well in the repertoire chosen here."
0,Dark with no salvation,"Reading is, for me, instructive, uplifting, entertaining, or enlightening. To be dark without any of the other attributes feels like a waste of time. This book wasted my time. I already know how cruel humans can be, and how badly we treat the planet. I kept waiting for the moral to rise out of the ashes, but none did."
1,One of the best Patriotic albums I have listened to!,"This is a wonderful album with beautiful heart-stirring patriotic songs, I like all the songs including God Bless America by Celine Dion and Coming out of the Dark by Gloria Estefan and though I normally don't listen to Mariah Carey I did like the song Hero, really if you have an open mind about music you can't go wrong with any of the songs on this album!"
1,She's My Little T&A,"""She's My Little T&A (Rock and Roll)"" is a bonus song on the DVD. This song definitely should have been included in the main movie. Keith Richards shows another of his good sides while singing this number. It's essential rock n roll."
1,Sign of the Beaver,I thought this was a great book. It might be better to read it aloud to children and explain some of the differences and likeneses of today and the past.

1,sea turtles ocean nomads,I think the story was educating for people who like to know what lives in the underwater life and about sea turtles.Conflict:explorers and divers are serching for an answer on how sea turtles live.Rising acion:they used tools to go down ''sea turtles cave''which was infested with sea turtle bones.Climax:divers took the bones to check how many pounds the largest sea turtle was.Outcome:workers found out everything they had to know about sea turtles and are now making a medicine to save the sea turtles from disise.
0,Thanks for the Warnings,"I have used TurboTax for quite a while, but after seeing 90% of all recent reviews negative, I'm using TaxCut this year.

0,"If You Like Elevator Music, You'll Like This CD","The first Kenny Rankin CD I bought was ""Because of You,"" a spare, jazzy CD from the early 90s. Loved it. This CD from 1980 is nothing like it, though. Producer Don Costa did Kenny a disservice by pouring syrupy ""elevator music"" arrangements on top of Kenny's voice. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this CD, and ""The Kenny Rankin Album"" (another Don Costa production). I'm going to try again with Kenny, but I'll stick to his later stuff and his ""live"" stuff. He's best when it's just him and his guitar or piano--he's great, he doesn't need any ""help."""

1,Bartok's Gothic Opera,"While I cannot repeat what the other review states, I can only say that he seems to be wrong about Samuel Ramey being Hungarian. Soprano Eva Marton is Hungarian and is doing a marvelous job as the newest victim of the devilish Bluebeard. The story is dark and symbolic. Bluebeard (not Bluebeard the Pirate) is a wealthy property owner who lives in a foreboding castle. He has just married wife No. 3. He warns her not to wander to a certain part of the castle. Naturally, curiosity gets the best of her and she searches the forbidden area despite his orders. What she finds there reveals a darker side to her husband. Eva Marton has a huge voice that fully captures every nunance of this character. Ramey has a terrific voice with all the right earthy and devilish tone for the part. Adam Fischer conducts Hungarian forces in Bartok's great work of Gothic and surreal drama."
1,Working on the Edge - a review,"This book about Alaskan crab fishing is somewhat dated, but it gives a wonderful first-hand account of what crab fishing was like 20 + years ago."
1,Wonderful book,"Good for both the newcomer and the experienced reader of healing. I have read this book two times, and every time is a new experience that creates an amazing aura of mindful positivity. It is not a book of religion yet it is full of wisdom from God. Thank you, Rachel!"
1,Great book even as a re-release,"Thought all the books in this series were good, even though they were re-releases, I had not read them prior to this. I understand alot of people were upset by the revamping and re-releasing but honestly all of the new Nora Roberts book have the NR seal on them stating when they are a ""never before released"" title so it's pretty easy to tell when it's a new book or not. Thought the content held up to the time difference pretty well, would recommend."

0,lies and dissatifaction,"the item i received was not that which was pictured in the item description. other than the stick handle, none of the other parts are plastic (which is what i was counting on) and i've already drawn blood while using the product. the spring was not correctly attached, so the entire spring mechanism/clamping part comes completely off. i'm very, very unsatisfied. i absolutely hate this mop head, and i dread having to use it."
0,Antiquated and stiff,"It is truly a wonder that Jesus hasn't already returned to Earth to pass judgement on socially blinded and hypocritical people like Martha Peace. Are we to believe that women's role in society today should be as it was 2000 years ago? Keep ""Catcher in the Rye"" and burn this book you stupid facist."
1,Love Da Blue,"When I first heard the hit I was amazed at what great work went into this piece. I was hooked at first sound to it. I was also suprised to hear that it is an Italian group that did it. I had never heard of an Italian group like this. Very good! Keep up the good work. By-the-way, Blue is my favourite colour."
0,Not happy...,"I bought this charm for myself cause it's my birthstone but when I recieved it I was not happy with the way it is made. It doesn't sit flat on your chest, no matter what chain you put it on. It's very small and I don't think the color is very good. I NEVER wear it!"
0,Computer does not recognize that the laser pointer is connected,I purchased this for office use. this pointer does not work with my lenevo IBM computer nor with any of my colleagues. The computer does not recognize that a new hardware is connected.very disappointed
0,Incorrect parts in package,I was pleased that I got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins I discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing. This incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since I had to stop and make a bushing. Maybe next time I'll just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in China.
0,90 minutes of your life you won't get back,I never write a product review but I wanted to write one to warn others about this movie. Everything you need to know about this is in the trailer. The nun on the front is actually a passerby in a scene and nothing to do with the film at all. If you want to see a really poor exorcist meets blair witch then this is for you. I regret watching this as my neither my wife nor myself enjoyed it despite the beautiful italian architecture that it doesn't even appreciate.
0,Not sure who will benefit from this,"Honestly, I was surprised to see that most of the reviews posted for this book have been positive. Although the book does contain some useful information, the vast majority of it seems to be little more than filler. John Hattan's review really sums it up much better than I can, so suffice it to say that if you're looking at this as a possible guide to help you create game art, you're likely to be disappointed, unless you're interested in the (very general) theory behind it. For every book I review, I try to be as fair as possible and at the very least state what kinds of people would enjoy the book, but I'm unable to do so in this case. Since (based on the reviews) there are at least a few people out there who might enjoy this, the best I can suggest is to read the TOC, or even better, browse the book at your local bookstore, before deciding whether or not to buy this book."
1,Hammond Middle East Atlas,"This is an adequate reference, but it is difficult to distinguish between the markings for international and internal boundaries."
1,Great product.,"It works great, although it seemed to work best the first time and not as well the second, but we've only done it twice now. Very entertaining for my kids. (3 yo girl and 4 yo boy)"
1,Connectivity for your Handspring at a very competitive price,"The Handspring modem is one of the middle class modems on the market, and Amazon is offering at a great price! If you want to connect to the internet on your handspring at a good price, then this is your best bet. Although it may not be the fastest OR the thinnest in its class, it functions very well. Besides, on a tiny screen with limited content, you don't need to have a 56k modem for the connection to be fast. And, if you don't mind, carrying around an extra half-inch on your palm isn't that bad. You would be amazed with what you can do with a palm pilot hooked up to the internet. On the go, I often synchronize avant-go, connect to AOL anywhere, and browse the web all in the palm of my hand. So, if you want to be truly ""connected"" then buy this modem while they last."
1,"Good, could be better","The game play is fun, but the graphics are a bit off. Too grainy (I have a 57 inch Sony Hi-Scan tv. Using monster gamelink composite PS2 cables, so its not the tv) Maybe I'm spoiled with the PC version of GTA 3 which is far superior graphically. I just rented this game and I think I'll hold off purchasing until they come out with the PC version. Hopefully soon"
1,Very happy with Extendatrunk in 2006 Wrangler,"All good. East to install and great fit and looks. Largest storage space. Three issues with instructions:1. They say to partially tighten the five bolts that hold the unit together but do not say when to tighten them. Turns out they can be fully tightened and the cover plate put on before ever putting the trunk into a 2006 Wrangler.2. The gap between the sliding top and the jeep door when the jeep soft top retaining bar is removed was not described. Some method should be included to resolve that gap by limiting the trunk top from sliding too far forward. However this is not a big deal.3. There were no instructions on using the ""tool"" to insert and compress the jeep side attachment points."
0,The Chambers Crossword Dictionary,I was very disappointed. As I use the Chambers Dictionary a lot I expected more from this book. It is just a thesaurus and not a very good one at that.
1,Enjoying Burke's Law,"Love Gene Barry...wonderful guest stars...great humor....all and all, an enjoyable show to watch. I only wish they would release the show in complete seasons rather than Volume 1 and Volume 2 per season. Releasing in volumes rather than complete seasons seems like just another way to get more money out of the fans."
1,Highly Recommend,"I recommend this book to many people. I love the easy to follow instructions. Have made several baby quilts, Trip Around the World and Double Irish Chain, from this book. Instructions are easy to follow and well written. One of my most used books."
0,Average Smooth Jazz,"'Collection of cool, urban, dinner/cocktail music.. raise a chilly cosmopolitan'. This is average smooth jazz that can be found on los angeles ktwv the wave radio station. It is not as 'cool' as it puts out, slow and a little funky. Sinatra-esque it ain't. If you strictly like smooth jazz, this is your cup of tea."
1,Perfect,"This dress is perfect! I ordered 4 of these dresses in black & pink for my wedding in March. They came in on a good time & I love them! The dresses ran a little bigger than I anticipated (about 2 sizes bigger), but they are great! I love them and will for sure order from this company again!"
0,"Simple, Ordinary Decorating","The homes and interiors all look ordinary, in simple, few decorations. I didn't get any interesting new ideas from most of these photos. I mainly saw different building styles and wood colors. At least 50% of them look just like first homes, I just couldn't tell any difference."
0,"To write the ""History of Madness"" is to be mad itself","The book became the leading voice of the anti-bourgeoisie hegemony in the times of Foucault. It was almost a bible for some those who styled their lives with regard to the story of Pierre Riviera who murdered his mother, brother and sister. It became the voice of the underground socialist intellectuals. It was a tool of the left-wing. The psychiatric establishment of the time attacked Foucault with most harsh diatribe.Trueman Myaka Tel:(031) 3036466"
1,Time Magazine,There was some overlap between my renewed subscription and my new subscription and it looks like Amazon made sure the new one didn't start until the old one ended. Time is one of the best news magazines on the market.
1,A must read,"Loosely based on the Children of Lir legend of Gaelic folklore, this book was astounding. Sorcha is a heronie who finds herself in a situation that would test the strongest and find them lacking. She discovers within herself a strength unknown and a resolve that could lose her the one she is destined to be with. She comes to the discovery that while blood binds, love strikes like lightning. You will say to yourself 'how beautiful' when you finally put it down [this is one you can't put down until you finish]. Ms Marillier has burst onto the Fantasy genre with pens blazing, and a skill to capture the reader that I rarely find."
1,Good music,"I originally bought this CD for the song Hallelujah, that was on the final episode of ER. I found that so many of the other tracks were easy to listen to and I enjoyed the entire CD. Funny that I never heard of this singer/song writter before."
1,VERY Well Written!,"This was one of the most awesome tapes I've ever listened to!!! It did have one or two dull songs, but the other songs were perfect! I think that their songs are creative, and full are harmony which sounds great! I would fully recomened this for boys, girls, and teens of all ages! You'll never get bored!"
0,The Second Half Was Good,"I was already a fan of this movie when I bought it so I recommend the film, but not this DVD. The copy I was sent only had the second half of the movie available to watch. I was very disappointed and because I did not watch this right away I couldn't return it. I will say make sure if you buy movies from here watch them as soon as you get them to make sure they work. This is the first time I had an issue with anything from this website."
1,Perfect,"Just what I needed, will easily fit in a backpack, light, and fills the tires fairly quickly. Literally the only negative is the lack of gauge, but you can get by on feel of the tire alone, so not a critical issue."
0,Nady WA-120LT/E does not perform well,"Bought system with lavalier mic and it did not pick up very well at all. Had to hold mic in front of my mouth, so what is the value of a lavalier mic. Ordered a headset mic at extra cost. This mic did pick up to some extent, but had a very hard time positioning the Portable system so that the signal picked up. Standing across the room in front of system did work ?OK?. Tried to use in a small room presentation, but eventually shut it down and spoke without the system."
1,Excellent Coverage,A comprehensive presentation of the ship's with accompanying photographs of the interesting development of the type of Warship that has become today the symbol of the 'Projection of Power'. Several generations ago the Royal Navy would send a battlefleet.
1,A Good One,"Not sure what to say but if you're thinking about buying ""A Perfect Circle"" you already know how they sound and you will not be disappointed here with this one. Too bad no more. Looking forward to Tool when they start recording again."
0,Amazing...while it works.,"Like most people who ordered this bottle my initial few uses were great. Keeps things cold and does not leak no matter what with a tough rubberized bottom. In less than a month however, the interior gasket is gone and now it leaks like a sieve. First of all where did the seal go? Did it just fall out during washing or did it fall apart and I ended up swallowing it? (Not a fun thought) I was very careful while washing and did it by hand watching the whole time so I am doubtful that it just fell out, but I guess it's possible.All in all it's a great product with a crippling design fault that makes it utterly unusable for it's intended purpose that costs more than bottles that do the same thing. How can I give it more than a single star?Edit: Going to attempt a return for a refund. I don't feel like being paranoid about the seal and wondering if it's going to fail when I have it in a backpack or somewhere else where if it started leaking again it would really suck."
1,"Finally, Something Works as Advertised","I have not had any cooling problems. I invested in this unit to hopefully keep it that way. It works exactly the way it should. It is not horribly loud. You can hear the fans but there are five extra fans, so you will hear them running. The noise is not obnoxiously loud.For those of you who have had troubles with the fans not shutting down after use, I feel for you and hope you can either have the unit repaired or replaced. My unit shuts down after the PS3 has be shutdown for 40-minutes...and that is after I have played games for more than 8-hours. I know, I am a game junkie :)Have a great Holiday!Smacka"
1,No lies here.,"I saw Dakota Skye last year at the Phoenix Film Festival and have been anxiously awaiting its release on DVD ever since. This is one of those rare movies that you really want to share with your close friends, but you find it impossible to sum up. ""A girl who can see through any lie falls in love with boyfriend's best friend..."" sounds simple, right? Doesn't come close to doing this movie justice. This film works its way inside and takes you on an emotional journey right along with the characters. Dakota's first line hooked me and something about that character pulled me all the way through to the end. Viewers will want to compare this to Juno, but as much as I enjoyed that film, Dakota Skye has a unique spark beyond comparison. Excellent direction and fantastic acting all around. This movie comes with my highest recommendation!"
1,Eno's take on minimalism,"I didn't know what to expect with this cd. Eno tries everything! I have always loved his catchy hooks, infectious rhythms and thought-provoking (or mind-numbing) lyrics.This cd is not ambient music, and it is not some form of heady satirical/lyrical rock. What it comes closest to is his take on minimalism, as apparently repetitive patterns are laid out, but slowly transform in different ways (not so repetitive after all!). It isn't dance music exactly, since it isn't that intense -- but it isn't entirely vacuous either. In my opinion, it's a welcome in-between: music to drift in and out of, while doing something else. I can sink into it at moments, or let it go on without me. It sparks my imagination without dominating my thoughts, and that's just what I was hoping for when I bought it."
1,Internal medicine on call,"I am a very busy guy, don't have too much time to read as a I would like to, but with this book which is very easy to read... I don't really get behind my work and help me to make some decision from time to time..."
1,This translation served my needs,"While I have a number of translations of Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" I wanted a newer one which would be easier to read in more or less modern English. This one suited my needs now.Ciardi is a poet rather than a Dante scholar, and his translation reflects that approach, but I found it very useful, especially with the extensive introductions and notes he provides. I would recommend this work to anyone who is new to Dante's contribution to Western literature."
1,"So Far, So Good...","I've owned mine for about a year, my first ever BT headset, purchased at a local RadShack for $50 - the only complaints that I have is that:A) when I'm not talking on it, the headset loses contact with my motorola phone and then usually pops right back in again. or not. depending. sometimes it works right away.. or not. damnit... :DAnd that:B) the MIC sensitivity is cranked way down with no adjustability (this is noise control?).It IS sensitive to proximity with both phone and LT, up to about 30-40' in line of sight, walls not degrading that is... Not bad for BT, according to specs... The battery life still lasts 2-3 hours on a short charge, tho I suspect that will soon degrade, but I have used this headset extensively, daily. Overall, I've been happy with it, and feel that I got my money's worth, but the rest of these horror stories??? Whew! I'll prolly buy something a bit lighter next time, too. peace y'all..."
1,Great to Help you remember Old Testament History.,"This is one of the best Old testaments movies I have seen yet and I have seen many. It is true to the Bible and very exciting.Old Testament history is hard to keep straight as so very much happens but this film will burn this time of Saul and David and his son Solomon in your mind and heart not to be forgotten.The acting is wonderful and everything looks real life, like you are there with them.There is of course a lot of killing. It may be too much for small children. Although David sins he still remains a man after God's own heart. God has mercy on him many times. He had to pay dearly for his sins. All that God foretold comes true.A must of all lovers of Old Testament history."
0,Just Shut Up And Sing!!,"The Hype is all that. HYPE! I bought the bossman's album after 9/11 and thought it was ok, but a little over dramatic. This last effore is no more than a political tool from someone that has their head in the sand. If I want the latest on Washington philosophical dribble, I will listen to talk radio, as I do alot. Bruce, Baby, JUST SHUT UP AND SING ALREADY! You sound like a liberal poetic college professor from an Ivy League school! Lame, Lame, Lame!"
0,WAY TOO MUCH SEX - and not enough real plot,"I have read and loved all of Laurell Hamilton's books - until this one. At least in the other books there was more than just sex going on and you could skip the sex parts and not feel cheated out of your money. If you tried to skip the sex parts in this book, you may wind up with about 20 pages of readable material ( and most of the real plot was rushed). I really hope her next Anita Blake novel is better and that her next Merry Gentry novel does not have the same problem as Incubus Dreams."
1,Best timer ever,This is the best timer I've ever used. It's simple to operate. Has a magnet and stand so that it can be angled for better viewing. Two timers makes it particularly useful and having minutes and hours makes it more versitile.
1,A bible without religion,"I am a metaphysical pragmatist. I am a Buddhist. Buddhist precepts were written 2500 years ago. So the language and approach to spirit is a bit dated to say the least. A Course In Miracles (ACIM) is the equivalent to an update on spirituality. It was not a ""Life Altering"" experience for me. That happened in 1980 when I was 31. That's when I decided to follow the teachings of The Buddha. ACIM is a reinforcement of my Buddhist practice laid out in Christian terminology. Even though it speaks in Christian terms its teachings are spiritually non-denominational. It is a textbook on what it is to be human. It is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it to all of you on your spiritual path. Peace and Love"
0,"Flat, boring, unoriginal","Very narrow narration..never goes beyond the characters and their DRUG problems..Trainspotting was about so much more than the drugs.. Characters are pretty unmemorable too, nothing special about them."
0,Too basic to be useful,"The author covers a variety of subjects but too lightly to be useful. Too much effort is spent on things that are useless. For example, Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book's title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design. Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with. Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques. Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all. Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that's available in Windows format free on the internet now. Horn designs are not covered and the project section only has a couple of basic designs. That said, the author does a great job telling you how to make inductors for cross-over networks.I was done with this 200 page book in about 1 hour. Rather dissapointing."
0,Broken after 10-month usage,I bought this product last July to ground food for my infant son. It's already broken last month after less a year of usage. The motor stopped working completely. I'm shocked at the low quality of this product. I'll not recommend buying it if you are looking for something more durable.
1,high quality,Excellent server rack which I found independent of our computer wiring contractor. they had a much larger rack in mind and I proposed this one. The system engineers and techs were very impressed with the quality and familiar with the manufacturer. highly recommend it.
0,"Bagel holder, not so good!",This bagel holder just slides on the counter as I am trying to slice it and of course not all bagels fit in it. It is hard to get the thing spread apart in order to cut through the opening in the middle. I went back to just cutting the bagles on the cutting board. Not worth your hard earned money.
1,Fun romance featuring two strong willed characters.,"I don't read many romances, but I liked ""Silver Moon Song"" (the book that follows this one in the series) so much that I had to come back and read this one. I was extremely glad that I did. Maggie and Cade's relationship is very complicated and passionate. These characters are well developed and very sympathetic to the reader. Ms. Dellin also writes some pretty good sex scenes here as well. I'm now anxiously awaiting the third installment in this series, which will feature Cade's sister Cotannah"
1,Good Game,Much better than the original Close Combat and in some ways better than Close Combat (Battle of the Bulge).
1,Nice bits,"I am very pleased with this set. These bits cut cleanly and do not burn your workpiece. The finished edge is very smooth. I have used Crafstman and viper bits before, and these are much better. With lesser quality bits, I spent a lot of time carefully going over the edge removing burn marks and smoothing out spintering. Never again."
0,Bogus - tota fabrication,I'm surprised that anyone could believe such nonsense. The film maker should be sued for libel. The film was based on speculation.
0,Untasty Beef Jerky,"I do not think Slim Jim's brand of jerky is tasty. No distinct flavors and is not reminiscent of Slim Jim brand snacks, for those that may feel there is a connection. In the world of jerky this one rates rather low. Personal opinion, I don't have any facts to back up my distaste for the jerky though. This is bargain jerky."
0,Not the cap I expected to receive,"Although the diameter of the cap lens bought is correct, based on the image, the one I received is different."
1,Great!!! Don't miss out on this!,"This movie is the funniest, cutest, most inspiring movie I've seen in a long time! The movie is done so purely and simply. This instantly sets you back to the fourth grade sock-hop when ballroom classes would've done you a lot of good. After having seen this, I'm definately putting my kids in ballroom classes."
1,"Good Book, Good Topic","It took me a chapter to understand where this book was going. But once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was interesting, and it was unique. The topic and idea of it made me think. It seems so real, the idea that we are being watched every moment by the Vast Machine. It is a quick read, and the only issue with the book, is that it ends with you knowing that there has to be another book. Excellant. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"Overlooked, but still a little gem","Everyone knows about Astley's skill as a producer, but his personal music went largely overlooked. I heard ""Jane's getting serious"" on alternative rock stations, and it had a bit of airplay, but the rest of the album went ignored. Big mistake. He writes modestly intelligent rock, and has a way with a catchy bit of rhythm guitar and keyboards. The beats are always just a bit different than what you would expect, and are very hypnotic. Worth a listen... There are a few cuts that are marginal, but ""Jane"", and ""Target Practise"" and ""Better Never than Late"" are good tunes. ""Jane"" is particularly good, and deserved the airplay it got."
1,Awesome devotion material for teens,"Kevin Johnson is no stranger to writing for youth. His latest contribution to this age group is a 365 day devotion book. The devotions are written to encourage youg believers to ""hang tight"" with Jesus. In about 10-15 minutes each day, readers can read a brief introductory paragraph, bible verses and an application. The devotions have been written in a fresh and clear language that should appeal to teens.--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf"
1,Parent of High School Student,"This is our first foray into SAT preparation and so far it is a good adventure. My daughter says that the system is easy to learn and use. The screen and the buttons are comfortable for the eyes and hands. The content of the multichoice questions is good. Admitedly it is not the coolest looking handheld product in the world. However, the portability of the unit was a big inducement for us -- she carries it around in her backpack and uses it in her free time. Shop around online because prices vary widely."
1,Iris Johansen IS Magnificent,"I am a tremendous fan of Ms. Johansen's style and craft. Her books are always such a thrill to read...in every sense of the word. Magnifcent Rogue was the first book I ever read authored by Ms. Johansen and I instantly became hooked. This book is full of suspense, romance, interesting dialogue and unique passionate love scenes. You won't be disappointed."
0,90 minutes of dreck...,It is becoming clear that Kevin James' humor does not translate to the big screen. I have every season of King of Queens and i think it is one of the top 10 tv shows of all time but i have a feeling i will be begging for this 90 minutes back at the end of my life. How on earth Nick Backay and Kevin James found this funny is beyond me. On a positive note i think that the 10 and under and the 70 and over crowd might enjoy this trainwreck. 0 stars.
1,Thank you Amazon,"This is a great game. But I knew it would be. Thank you, Amazon.com. You had a Nintendo promotion and I got it for a great price. Thank you."
0,"Good concept, but weak connector.","The dual volume controls are a great idea. I love ear cover headphones, the wife likes ear-buds and the mismatched types meant volume levels were never right. This little cable solves the issue when two folks are sharing media. The issue I have is the input plug is not designed for even the lightest of tugging of the cable. The entire plug seems to start coming apart after just a bit of use.. If the input is redesigned, this would be a great device."
0,Not as advertised,"The description for this item was ""Stanley Hardware 3-Inch Corner Brace, Mechanically Galvanized"". It is definitely not that. The description given and the image seemed to match, but what showed up was totally different.I would not order anything from ""acehardwareoutlet""."
1,CD-Rom is the real value,"If you're short on time like I was, don't bother too much with the book. Just read the lessons in each section and then go straight to the full-length sample tests. Remember, those tests are scored much lower than the actual GMAT. My actual score was 150 points higher than any score I received on the sample tests. I only used this book and I feel like it prepared me pretty well. Friends who have used it in conjunction with other books scored pretty similarly to me."
1,Great!,"Being Trekkies, we love all of the Star Trek movies. Love all the graphics in the NG movie set, too."
1,SD400 Leather Case,"Case does good job of protecting camera from scratches, and hole in top gives access to strap."
1,Characters and Issues of Depth,"I was captured by characters that inspire, questions that are timely if we are to create the future we want, and a land and culture that is timeless. A masterful work."
0,Enough already!,"Another season, another set of losers from American Idol. Proving further how far down the tubes the American taste factor has dropped."
1,Dr. Phil to the Rescue!,"He has some very interesting ideas, methods and approaches and the book is easy and interesting to read. In fact, Dr. Phil would ""turn therapy on its ear"" [my words]; his take on marriage counseling makes a lot of sense. My main reservation is with his apparent belief and insistence that EVERY relationship (except the physically abusive one) CAN BE SAVED. A bit dogmatic, though if you seek help for your relationship, this is a good place to turn to--along with a good therapist! We should remember that most couples who go for ""marriage counseling"" end up divorced, and that's not the fault of the therapist (most people really know they'll split up eventually, I think). But if both partners really want to stay together, this book will help."
0,Tries too hard,"Fun with Dick & Jane is a so-so remake of the 70's original with George Segal and Jane Fonda. Updated in the era of Enron and high-tech electronics, it loses a lot of the innocent, free-spirited fun of the original. Carey, as usual, has some scenes that have no other purpose than to showcase his rubber-faced expressions and Leoni seems rather tired of the whole thing. I actually fell asleep two-thirds of the way through; for a comedy, that's not a good thing."
1,Pleasantly suprised,"I ordered a vehicle adapter kit for my satellite radio and had absolutely no problems at all ordering it and on top of that,delivery was a day earlier.Would recommend to all--Thanks."
0,"A little difficult, not much of a workout","I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's."
1,GREAT PRODUCT!,"Delicious rice pudding which is quick and easy to make! I can't find it in my local stores anymore, though. The packaging has changed, and it is no longer called Americana Rice pudding, just Fat-Free Rice Pudding. Still has the same ingredients, though, and very tasty!"
0,Pretty good,"I didn't like this CD as much as I liked the first one. I think the songs are all monotonous, and the only good ones are Out of Control and Same Direction."
0,Masquerading as architecture,"This is nothing more than a glossy brochure for a mediocre builder. The homes showcased are better suited for a spot on MTV's ""Cribs"" than publication under the misnomer of architecture."
0,Waste of Money,I would never buy another Coby product. Believe all the negative reviews. The unit will start humming and then will stop playing. The CD playback was intermittant. The warranty is useless. I wish I read the reviews before I bought mine. After 92 day it is junk.
1,YAY!,"I loved this movie! It's fresh and funny. And the coffee part with the little old man is hilarious! Plus, it's got some bonus features, which I really don't remember alot about. Good family comedy, but watch out for the more adult parts. *hint* hint* Have fun with it! A great edition to your DVD corner."
1,Best spy series ever.,"The Sandbaggers is not what most people would expect -- it's about the politics of intelligence wrok, the planning, and most of all, the waiting to here if an op has gone off. The acting is good, the scripts and verisimilitude superb. It's a great look into the espionage game circa 1978-80.The transfer leaves something to be desired, but it's still watchable. Here's a show that could do with a restoration job."
1,OCCIDENTAL MUSIC,"Guitar drags around pounding drum kit and trippy-dippy vocals that shout like an adolescent in teen-angst sexual transformation. This compilation of singles and B-sides is an entirety in itself with the loud rhythmic guitar creating a climaxing crescendo that rises and breaks in guitar heaven in the final two songs, ""Forged It"" and ""Home At Dawn"". Great stuff, and smart too! Superchunk's insights into teen wanderlust and adult misgiving speak to the teen in all of us and if Superchunk had their way they would crawl right back to babyhood and re-utter their very first syllables in the hope of charting a course to a less troubled but less tuneful adult."
0,received used part,"This ACdelco D1922A was purchased on the assumption the part was new @ $114. Corrosion on the bottom and depression marks on the connector seal indicated the ICM was used. The part works but for how long? Stocklift LLC maintains they do not sell used parts. They obviously don't know their inventory. To be fair, had I noticed this before my 30 day expiration, the part would have been replaced. For that I give them 1 star."
0,Bad Amazon description,"I had to send this back, because the Amazon description is so bad. It fits Dodge Ram 1500 for LATER years, not earlier. Before buying one of these, make sure it fits your truck. I bought this one, read the package, called the manufacturer, and learned that I needed LH-006 rather than this one. Once I got the right one, it worked fine."
0,You don't need fake food to make quick desserts...,"This book was such a disappointment. If I'm going to consume the extra calories, fat and sugar involved in dessert, I want to make sure it's a worthwhile experience. Taking a box of cookie dough powder and adding water DOES NOT EQUAL dessert. I'd rather have a bowl of strawberries with some softly whipped cream to which a drop of vanilla and a pinch of sugar have been added. And what's with the bagged angel food cake? I wouldn't use that stuff as a sponge to clean my bathroom - but Sandra Lee seems to love the stuff. Canned pie filling? Egads."
1,This one scores a direct hit,"Unlike ""Dive"", which drowns in silly lyrics, this album has everything a lover of Brightman's angelic voice could want. Her interpretation of ""My Heart Will Go On"" deserves placement next to Dion's, her rendering of my old Kansas favorite ""Dust in the Wind"" is remarkable, and the Enya-esque track ""Scene D'Amour"" is simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. None of the other 13 songs disappoint, either. Buy it and play it on a rainy day to brighten your mood, or, even better, in a candlelit bedroom."
1,It depends really on what you want to use this book for...,"The book is inspiring if you are looking for something to motivate you in a purist woodworking way. It is not necessarily a how to book, but more of a how to approach woodworking, written in the ""old school"" philosophy of a master crafstman. Hence the title... ""The Fine Art of... "" The version of the book I have is from the 70's complete with all black and white pictures. I probably got more out of this book than others in my woodworking libray of the more expensive glossy fluff books put out by many of the current publishers looking to catch your pocket book with eye candy. There is substance to this book and not fluff. It is not a step by step guide (for the most part)."
0,Happy ending for Animal Farm? Orwell would hate it,"TNT wasted the emormous talent of its team and guests to produce the happy ending that Orwell would both hate and understand. Combining this with the happy ending to th eproducers on broadway leads me to the next ""happy colorization"" of historically sginificant dark stories --------------- Life after death of a salesman (Arthur Miller) Willie Loman will buy, then short Amazon, and live happily ever after."
0,What the heck...?,"The only reason I bought this is because the movie is cheap and I wanted to see exotic cars in action. The only saving grace of this movie is that it is cheap. The story is blah, and the cars couldn't even save this movie. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Good product,"Nice and big and the foam is really tough too which means it won't compress and get smashed. We use this to prop my wheelchair bound father up when he is eating in his hospital bed, which does not lift him up enough, vertically. He needs to be sitting fully straight to not choke on his food and this product definitely helps him in that area. Great product and could be used under the legs as well as. And, as always, Amazon Prime is #1."

0,THIS IS NOT CLARK ASHTON SMITH!,"For those who wonder, this is NOT a work by the fantasist Clark Ashton Smith, as advertised by Amazon.. but rather it's a crime novel by the British writer Clark Smith."
0,Disapointed,"My name is Eleanor , I am 6 years old (writing this with daddy)- I am very disapointed, that this particular toy does not work like they said it would. right when I started using it I discovered that it didnt work. THere was only 1 bubble sometimes from the fish, It was noisy. My daddy took it back to the storeBye"
1,The Trick to Money is Reading this Book!,"If money, both making and keeping it, has ever been an issue in your life, you can't afford not to read this book. Wilde teaches us not to take it all so seriously and then slips in very subtle but powerful techniques that will have you in abundance in no time. First and foremost, Wilde will teach you to laugh at yourself...and others...in remarkably healing ways. Not for the weak minded, Wilde makes you think it through and come to an understanding that works in the financial world today. My net worth has improved immensely since discovering this book. He will make you mad, then have you laughing. All in all, better entertainment than a movie, more healing than a session with your shrink and more workable financial savvy than my broker ever hinted of!"
0,"Wow, this was bad!","Apart from the fact that the main 'heroine' literally talks outloud to herself (And then answers aloud), in their initial meeting the 'hero' saves her from two would-be rapists and then proceeds to bathe her and put her naked in his bed once she faints (creepy!). Oh, and the heroine has an imaginary lover named 'Loverboy' who's existence ensures she comes across as pathetic to readers.This book is FULL of 'huh?' moments and phrases (the above is just the tip of the iceberg). Not a pleasant reading experience."
1,Not sure why this one is ignored,"In 1957 Ms. Vaughan recorded an album at Chicago's ""Mr Kelly's."" It has been regarded as one of Vaughan's best live performances. ""After Hours at the London House"" is the follow-up to that album. The London House was a popular night club at the corner of Wacker and Michagn Ave in Chicago. Now a Burger King (alas!), Oscar Peterson recorded a live album there also. Ms. Vaughan's London House date was recorded the same night after she did two shows at Mr Kelly's. She clearly is tired (that is very clear at the end of the CD) but there is a very cool late night, low enegry vibe to the affair. The recording quality is great, especially on Vaughan's voice. She is backed by a quartet that includes trumpeter Thad Jones.If you liked Vaughan at Mr Kelly's you should grab this CD. At the rate that back catalog is going away, I wouldn't wait too long."
0,Fails every time,"I have purchased one of these for each of my two children within the last 2.5 years. My older child's machine started to fail within 6 months - once turned on, the white noise would fade in and out, or turn off completely while she was sleeping. Same thing happened in less time (3 mos?) for second child's machine. Bought replacement for both, and they're starting to do the same thing. I will be sure to spend more $ on a nicer brand in the future."
1,Basic Information,This DVD is very good. It shows valuable basic information about Saxophones. It was very helpful!
1,What I was looking for.,"I bought this book as a gift for my grandchild who wants to start cooking. As I looked though it, I was pleased at its contents. It has the basics explained well with recipes that are simple but not so simple as to be boring. Actually my daughter has used it (mother of the child I bought it for)and was pleased with the recipe she used. I would recemmend this book to anyone interested in beginning cooking."
0,I would never touch it even with a 10 ft pole,"What the heck do them people think when they design a printer like Epson Stylus 750. Do they think they will be the only one who will go out and buy and use it. Is that why they don't care to make a user friendly product. An ordinary guy does not know how to configure or do set ups or mess with default settings. The only default we are all trying not to do is on our rent payment. Most average guys lost their brain the last time they did the *\space/ while using computers with dos base ..... So I say to Epson, if your printer is so good, why not buy all of them yourself ................."
0,Lousy Binding,"I've read all but ""A Christmas Carol"" in this edition. I've found several typos. Moreover, the binding is becoming unglued. I estimate by the time I finish ""A Christmas Carol"" the binding will be totally exposed. I value permanent books (otherwise I would buy paperbacks). I suggest anyone who enjoys Dickens buy a better edition."
0,Too much copy guard,"I purchased this game, loaded it and tried to run it only to findthat the copy guard on the CD is so strong that when I try to start the game it rejects the CD. Sierra technical support finallly admited that they went overboard this time with their copy guard protection and some CD ROM drives will not work with the CD in the game. I have one of those drives (72x Kenwood). Contacting Kenwood did no good as they refuse to ""Crutch"" Sierra's problems.This is a true example of the term: ""Buyer Beware"""
1,Gorgeous Alec Guiness,"Alec Guiness was really glowing in this gem. This is definitely among his best movies - the character is as wily as the actor, acting within acting within acting...He is so comical that it is hard to imagine this is the same actor who was George Smiley in Tinker Tailor.He was really sui generis."
1,Works Great!,"I bought this for my small-medium size dog who was barking after I left for work in the morning much to the consternation of my neighbor. My neighbor says that since I put it on my dog, the situation has much improved! My dog is very sensitive and doesn't like the citronela, but it does not hurt her. She doesn't look sad after she gets a little spray."
0,so so,"The plot had too many holes. For example, when the USDA inspector was caught in the record room of the slaughterhouse wouldn't the management in reality at least hide the files she discovered the incriminating evidence in? Instead they returned the file so that it can be conveniently found again and stolen by the main character at the end of the book. Not believable."
0,Where have you gone Flickerstick?,"Key problem: Overproduction. What kind of drugs did Sony/Epic get Flickerstick hooked on? Whatever pill, powder, or juice it was, I don't ever wanna try it. In the song ""Coke"" they changed the chorus from ""Lie here NAKED with my girl."" to ""Lie here TAKEN with my girl."" What? (...) A band can have a radio hit titled ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" but a reference to nudity is over the line. (...) Buy the indy release of Astronauts if you can still find it. Infintely superior, a near classic. This overproduced version, however, is nothing short of a catastrophe."
0,Quality,"This is just it...Why spend time on a single, when you got more and better on their album ""Tyranny For You"".Is it worth the effort to stick in a single for 10 minutes of fun? Stick to the longplaying.""Tyranny for you"" is a great Allboom"
1,Good product,This product turned out to be not what we needed..we needed an angle on our hitch because the car is so low. This was just what it claimed to be and well priced.
1,Highly Satisfied,I bought this used and it is like brand new! I'm so excited to give it to my daughter on Christmas. She is going to love it!
0,not so good,"made a pot of this coffee and none of our guests like it. it was bitter and strong no matter how much i decreased the amount, i gave it away to needy in-laws."
1,"Inside Star Trek, the real story.","I am quite convinced that this is a very honest volume, and assessment of the events around the original Star Trek, and it's producer, Gene Roddenberry. The fact that both authors were executives at Desilu studios, and had to agree on the facts, and that both intended to write about it, though with some distance from the original, gives a huge wieght to their story, which is at odds with some other writing and interviews. Events in the book are often backed up with reproduced documents, from thier files. Detail about the workings of the studio are somewhat tedious. Flaws in Roddenberry's character are laid bare, as are the 'adult' activities around the production. People whom worship Trek, or Roddenberry himself may be offended. There are also brutally honest stories of the writers and talent in the show. Definitely for adults."
0,Bush's Brain,"This film stinks because it is a lie. It cuts down the president in time for the election. It is slanted and untruthful. It portrays our intelligent, strong, and integrity filled presidentas a puppet."
0,"Yes, Extremely Biased Book","To all commentators who are trying to justify the biasness of this book, you should be ashamed.This book has a MAJOR tilt to the left in terms of how it looks at not only economics, but history.The Reagan bashing is childish and arrogant and the anti-capitalist economic theories are very one-sided, yet disguised as intelligent because it is thorough and detailed.The economic growth of the 80's and 90's and the higher standards of living and worker gains in those era's hopefully will, or should have made this book completely irrelevant."
1,"Great Item, Bad Description","When you need a little flow and want to use a little juice, this is a great pump. However it is NOT stainless or bronze construction like the description says, it is cast iron and therefore should only be used in closed heating systems."
1,now 19,"Ok, ok, I know that this is supposed to be a review for Now 18, but I can't review for Now 19 anywhere else. The music on Now 19 is much more updated, with hits like ""Hollaback Girl"" and ""Baby I'm Back."" But it's still a little outdated with ""Mockingbird."" It should have been ""A** Like That."" And ""Somebody Told Me"" instead of ""Mr. Brightside."" Overall, I think this Now CD is much more updated than previous ones."
0,WRONG PRODUCT,"I HAD BUY THIS THIS PRODUCT, BEFORE BUT YOU LIE TO ME SAYING ANTONY SANTOS IN CONSERT RELEASE JULY 2006 AND WHEN I SEE THE DVD IS THE SAME CONSERT OF 2004, I SAID FOR GET IT AND I GAVE IT AWAY, BUT I FEEL I WAS ROB BY AMAZON, IS ALL GOOD, I JUST WONT BUY ANYTHING ALSE THRU YOU BECAUSE YOU SAID IS BRAND NEW, AND IS AN OLD VERSION, SO SORRY BUT I DID LOOSE MY MONEY WITH AMAZON, THANK YOU."
1,Such a valuable book,"My husband and I left the Word of Faith movement years ago, but not until I heard Hank Hanegraaff's radio show (and subsequently bought this book) did I realize there were Christians out there combatting the false doctrines of the movement.I thank God for Hank Hanegraaff, as he has laid out so clearly in this book the problems with Word of Faith doctrine. Simply put, Word of Faith is unscriptural and contradicts orthodox Christianity. I think any Christian (especially those who've encountered Word of Faith teaching) would benefit immensely from reading this book.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the book isn't the academic treatment of this topic that I would like. I would love, for example, to read a more thorough analysis of how Word of Faith teaching derives from the teachings of EW Kenyon. That said, Hanegraaff definitely documents his sources -- which greatly bolsters his arguments."
0,"great art work, unsatisfying story","I was drawn to these books by the art work, which has a mystical quality. Taking the letters out of the envelopes was fun; you felt as if you were eavesdropping on someone's private mail. However, the story teased and promised, but in the end, delivered nothing. It also left loose ends. Whatever became of the guy who was harrassing Sabine?"
1,Zampano's lone album review,"I've never taken the time out of my day to write a review, but I will do so to promote Micah. I was reading in a small coffee shop one day and heard an album being played that I immediately fell in love with. I asked the waiter, and he said that he coincidentally went to high school in Maine with the musician and highly recommended checking him out. I did. Many thanks to the waiter. Now just patiently awaiting Micah's next US tour. Check this album out, the one I'm recommending to friends more than any other."
0,Horrible,A very bigoted book that blames the poor for not following the rules she has decided are essential.
0,Ouch!,"This album is very scary. I wanted to like it as I love Minnelli through her ""New York, New York"" era (late 70s), but she just doesn't have it anymore. Her voice is gone and the wobble in her vibrato is even more pronounced than it ever was. If albums are awarded five stars due to bad singing and poor enunciation, then this would warrent five plus."

1,"Weird, but gorgeous",A perfect example of a grotesque novel. McCullers examines love and the meaninglessness of life with her odd and ugly characters.Definitely worth reading.
0,DO NOT!!! order this!!!,seriously!!! do not order this in amazon.i bought this subscription 2 months ago. i never got the magazine instead i got all kinds of trash in my mail box and e-mail as well. i think what they do is sell your personal information and that's why the subscription is so cheap. i'm so angry that even if i cancel the subscription i will still get all kinds of trash in my mail box.
1,Great dress,"I was happily surprised with my dress! It is lovely and is a great bargain. The bust does run quite large, so plan to have alterations done on the top. It is a flattering dress on women who are size 12 and up especially. The medallian in the center of the dress is a pin, so it can be removed if you don't like it. I'm using my dress for a bridesmaid dress. I highly recommend this dress!"
1,James Horner: In a League of His Own,"I think James Horner ranks as one of the best composers of film soundtracks of our time. Every time I listen to one of his compositions (and ""A Beautiful Mind"", is no exception), I literally get chills. If music is a universal language, then he is able to communicate the brilliant, yet tortured mind of John Nash, Jr. to the audience, which helps us all to understand what this film was all about: love conquering what could have ultimately been his death sentence."
0,really nice looking but poorly made,i have already had 2 of these controller and they both have broken. they are made very poorly and break very easily. do not buy this item.
1,For lovers of 1984 and Brave new world.,"I really enjoyed this book. I've only read a few Margaret Atwood books but I enjoyed Handmaids Tale so I thought I would try Oryx and Crake. In addition, I enjoy books such as 1984, Brave New World which present a dystopian future. I found it quite fascinating how she extrapolated current trends in genetics and computing to come up with a very bizarre yet somehow plausible future."
0,what,wow 5 episodes? and the packaging.. isnt even the same as the first season.. why are they shorting us with these?i couldnt imagine the 2nd season actually being only 5 episodes.
1,Terrific Book,"I guess i'm late, cus microsoft is now phasing out MCSD! Anyway i did both 70-175 and 70-176 yesterday (April 26th, 2004) and i Aced both exams (900 and 814 respectively). I primarily used this book, it covers everything u need to know. The great thing is that Mr. Foxall actually did thesed xams and understands exactly what they're about and as such does an excellent job in presenting the material. The chapter on Package and deployment and COM are the best i've seen yet! THIS BOOK + TEST KING practice questions EQUALS PASS."
0,Gravity Fails!,"The sound works for Disney intro, but does not work for entire episode. Please fix and would like to know when it works or would like a refund. Please review videos before they are posted to insure proper functionality. I'm really Hesitant to buy any other episodes from Amazon. 1 star because i know it will be fixed."
1,George Foreman In/Outdoor Grill,"This is the second GF Grill we've purchased. As we live in an apartment & gas or charcoal grills are not allowed, this electric grill is great. A breeze to clean, just wipe off with a paper towel, and easily taken apart for thorough cleaning. And it cooks quickly. A winner!"

0,You get what you pay,"Don't waste your money with this camera, it doesn't have optical zoom and it goes thru the batteries very very quickly-so you will need to buy rechargeable batteries. But for less than $100 you can't expect much.On the other hand the software is very user friendly as is the camera."
1,Soft Wallet,"I bought this for my husband. It's light weight. It's soft and wears like iron! There are loads of compartments to put cards, license, etc."
1,Great Book!,"Great book! This was my first J.L. Bourne book and I finished is within a day. I had to overnight the sequel, Beyond Exile, because I needed to know what happened next. The character development is great they way it is written like a journal leaves great spots to take a break (if you can put it down)."
0,stage one of a long road of development,"The Good""Radio"" has a catchy chorus and memorable chord progression. ""Drown"" is an emotionally charged ballad with a decent chorus section. ""Any Place but Here"" has one of those sing-along sections that are sure to come back to you throughout the day. The heaviest riffs are delivered on ""This Girl,"" and it's probably the most melodic track as well.The BadVocalist Sal Scoca just doesn't have it. In the immortal words on the American Idol judges, he's just too ""pitchy."" The music is somewhat generic as well.The VerdictCore Records pride itself on producing bands the old fashioned way; molding and developing them over a number of years. With Crashbox's latest disc, it's obvious the band is at stage one of a long road of development."
0,NOT A WORTHWHILE UPGRADE,After loading the software I tried a few of the new features and found some of them to be quite useful.The ability to view thumbnails easily and catalogue has great potential -- perhaps more so for a hobbyist than a professional with thousands of images. However there is not much that one could not already do with Elements 2 and a curves plug in. I believe Elements 2 is a great product. The response and performance of the version 2 is adequate. All the Adobe photoshop products have a learning curve -- but this product seems to be unwieldy and slow. It locked up my machine and took a long time to load.I returned it and will continue to use Elements 2 -- a great product. Not so for Elements vers 4. It needs more work.
0,music fan,"This has to be one of the most over rated bands of all time. Some songs are good, but most are talentless rants, and over gained power chords."
1,Best Show on TV !!!,"Easily the Best show on television currently.If you are looking for drama, great characters, a great plot, a great mystery, and great scenery this is the show for you.From the opening scene of the plane crash to the cliffhanger of what was down the ""hatch"", this show has it all !I re-watched the dvd before watching the new season, and I did not realize how many subplots and signs that I missed. That is the beauty of the DVD !Hopefully, you are now watching Season 2 !"
0,Wait for the Movie,"If you like to watch the TV shows ""Friends"", ""Coupling"", ""How I met your mother"", ""Sex in the City"", ""The Single Guy"" or ""Nova"" and you're looking for a story to read, than this book is for you.If you haven't read a book for pleasure for a long time but your looking for a ""How To"" book, then this book isn't for you. Read the book ""The Sensuous Man"" instead.I listened to Neil Strauss at a book signing. He ""tours"" with self proclaimed losers who call them themselves former losers who sell ""How To Pickup Women"" services. They sell nothing but air --- and that's free.If you're looking for a story but not a book reader, wait for the movie coming to theaters in 2008."
1,piracy as 18th century naval tactics,"This well written book on Anson and his fleet, heading off in search for the prize of all the oceans (in order to bankrupt the enemy - yeah, right), is a tale of blind navigation, luck and misfortune while circumnavigating the world.While the story of Anson, especially in China and Manila made him a hero in England - I found it interesting to read the East Indies Company assessment of his voyage (disaster) and bumptous behaviour, especially in China. I also thought that since the company had been there for almost 100 years, it seemed most strange that Navy and Civilian (Trader) did not provide each other with any knowledge - navigational or otherwise - two worlds really.The elephantine workings of the ""Prize"" Court in awarding shares was also worth the read... no wonder later sailors always made sure every i was dotted and t crossed!"
1,Brain Dead Souls,Great episode. I'm completely hooked on Walking Dead. This show has got me dreaming about zombies. I can't wait to see the next episode.
0,Broke on impact,I bought this and a different sword to fight with because I'm a nerd. The other sword was awesome and stayed intact but this one did not and shattered after a few blows. Also when I first got it a nail was sharp and sticking out. Don't recommend.
1,Great little desk fan,"I bought this in spite of a handful of negative reviews up here, and I'm posting to provide a counterpoint.The Zippi is a great little desk fan that, while nearly silent, moves a surprising amount of air. I actually put it down on the low setting because too much air in my face gets annoying. The Zippi is perfect for those of us who work in climate-controlled offices that are a little too climate-controlled in favor of the ladies who need everything uncomfortably warm. It provides just the right amount of personal airflow. No more, no less.Anyone buying this thinking it's going to cool more than their face and torso is sadly looking for something else. Like, maybe, something bigger and noisier.Great for offices/apartments ... bad for cooling large rooms in the Cayman Islands in Summer with no air conditioner. It's made by Vornado and has excellent build quality. I'd buy another if I had two faces."
0,This was obviously never proofread.,"The text of the 10.55 paperback edition is nearly illegible. Some pages are entirely in computer code, and there are countless severe typographical errors on every page. If you have any intention of reading this text, do not buy the copy pictured on the product page."
1,A Spiritual Must Read,"This book is incredibly well researched and is filled with fascinating theories and facts. In the genre of ""Gulliver's Travels,"" The DaVinci Code raises issues that have been ignored by mainstream Christianity for centuries. If you have any interest the true relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, you're going to love this book."
1,Great for a massage room,"My husband and I have a ""spa room"" with a massage table in our vacation home. This CD is great for massages! It's just like what you hear when you go for a massage. Very relaxing."
1,Get This If You Want To Hear Pink Floyd Done With A Symphony,"If you can appreciate the sounds of an orchestra, and you like Pink Floyd, there is no questioning that you should have this album. It is magnificent. Go for it."
1,Exquisite Account of Romani Gypsy Life,"From start to finish this book touched my soul and transported me to a time and place that has seemingly long been lost. From detailed descriptions of Romani Gypsy life to personal accounts of his upbringing as a Chovihano, or Romani Gypsy shaman, Jasper Lee fills the pages and the mind of the reader with bright and colorful narratives that compel and draw the reader into another world. This is truly a gem among books, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in any aspect of gypsy life, but especially those interested in the spiritual and mystical traditions of the gypsies and gypsy culture. My hat off to Jasper Lee and his courage in sharing such a personal accounting of his life, his knowledge and wisdom, and in opening us to a world heretofore kept silent."
0,Very disappointing performance of Dixit Dominus,"If the use of 'pedestrian' to describe a music performance is ever justified, this would be it. This is a horrible, horrible performance of Dixit Dominus - this piece demands a lot of the choir, but they don't even try to hit the right pitch. Handel would not appreciate this cacophony. I don't remember much of the remaining on the disc. I was too dismayed that I donated my copy to the school library."

1,Another classic Heep album,"Sweet Freedom is yet another offering by the band's classic lineup full of magical music. This album is best known for ""Stealin'"" the band's second all-time best-known song next to ""Easy Livin'"" from Demons and Wizards. That one is a classic rocker. However, there are other great musical monents on this disc: The raveup guitar of ""Dreamer"", the gorgeously beautiful arrangements of the title track and ""If I Had the Time"", the physchadellic spaciness of ""Seven Stars"", the gentle acoustic guitar of ""Circus"" and the rock-theatre epic ""Pilgrim"". A standy in the Uriah Heep catalog and of seveties music."
1,VERY detailed book,"I just got this little book yesterday.....as a matter of fact, I just took my fly rod out for a test run yesterday...the first time I've ever used one of these things! The previous reviewer gets close to the point about this one. I never knew there was so much to using one of these things! It really is akin to swinging a golf club. This is a very detailed book, covering everything from how to hold your wrist to what the loop of the line should look like as it whizzes over your head on the backcast. If I don't catch any fish after reading and learning how to do this stuff then I'm going to be really disappointed. Really!"
0,Not Accurate,"Agreed with a couple of the other reviews...this scale is not accurate!I have the scale on a flat surface, but when just stepping on it for a weight reading, it fluctuates rapidly WAY over what I wheigh...I have to try to stand perfectly still to get it to settle on a weight, but it is typically 50 pounds over my normal weight. If I step on it 2-4 more times, it will eventually give me a result that is at least in the right area...but I can't trust it at this point.I had no problems with the BF portion of it, other than it is a pain to get down on the floor to push the buttons.It is asthetically pleaseing, but for the cost, I don't think the weight function works right. I intend to return this one."
0,A weak defense of the undefendable,"Weiner's book is not so much a survey of fraud among historians so much as it is a tu quoque defense of Michael Bellisle and others who share Weiner's particular predjudices. Yes, Doris Kearns Goodwin plagerized, as did Stephen Ambrose, and both should be (and were) condemned for that. But somehow Weiner turnes this into an argument that Bellisles, who fabricated evidence and lied in support of a false hypothesis, was unjustly pilloried. Somehow, I don't see the connection."
0,Terrible,"I found this book to be simply unreadable. Too much trite dialogue and a very unlikable, whiny author. I muddled through to page 87 and had to put it down. If you're interested in Julia Child, I highly recommend My Life in France by Julia Child--excellent!"
1,Why the low rating?,"We rented this movie three or four nights ago at about 9:00. We started it as soon as everybody was downstairs and never stopped it. What can I say? I loved it! I still don't understand why it got such a low rating. I mean, this film is hilarious. True, the two lead actors aren't my favorite, but Kathy Bates ""Sue"", Terry Bradshaw ""Al"", Bradley Cooper ""Demo"", Justin Bartha ""Ace"" and Zooey Deschanel ""Kit"" made the trip worthwhile. I have to say that my two favorite characters are Ace and Kit.Great movie. Looooove iiiiiiit!4/5"

1,It was good but not great,"The Jetsons movie had too much music from Tiffany (Judy Jetson) and is missing Coswell Cog's sprockets, Henry Orbit, Rudy the computer, and a lot of comedy. But other wise it was good."
0,How many English bands can you name in 60 minutes?,"The only reason to buy this is if you want to find out a little (very little) of the history of Oasis. The rest is total rubbish. There is no Oasis music and the few (very few) sound bites are almost unintelligible. If you can stay awake despite the mind-numbing soporific riff which repeats in the background every 20 seconds or so, you will find that the producers seem more interested in impressing you with their seemingly endless list of English bands rather than telling you anything about Oasis. They assert that Shakermaker is a plagiarism of ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"", so obvious, Noel incredibly escaped a lawsuit. Apparently, they never listened beyond the first two bars of the song. Beyond that, ShakerMaker just isn't the same song. If this is an example of the quality of their material, you have to wonder about all the other tales they tell. If you feel you must listen to this, buy it used and then sell it even more used. 0 stars."
1,Season Two.,"This season is interesting bc things are changed up a bit. I like how the selection for models was a lil different, but unfortunately it felt like the talent was bland compared to the first season. More inovated thinkers as far as design goes but they didnt all seem to grasp the concept of the client. Love the show but would love to see greater talent."
0,who could expect anything from this mess?,"this, like the entire nightmare on elm street is another dull, silly and boring excuse for a movie. No one should expect anything but boredom from this."
1,The best combo,"This is the best games put together in a special offer!!!!Whoever said they had F-15 and USAF but not IAF, you have to type in Israili Air Force to get it by itself.( Israili is spelled wrong I don't know hoe to speel it, but still it brings you to IAF"

1,from shy to charismatic,Wonderful read. this book really details how to converse and mingle. I am a self proclaimed shy guy and this has done wonders. keep it Mrs. lowndes
1,Surprisingly Good,"Black N' Blue were one of those ""2nd Tier' Hair Metal acts from the 80s....a band that was just as good and talented as the top-shelf acts but for whatever reason weren't that successful. So, it is to my shock and awe that they actually have a new album out. And, just like as in the 80's, this material blows away the more well-known and bigger selling acts!There are only three or four throwaway tracks on this platter - everything else is pretty good. This DEFINILTEY blows away new releases from Bon Jovi and Def Leppard, that's for sure!"
1,Very Cute Frame,"I purchased this for my husband as a gift. Its a great little frame. We did our daughters hand print, and the molding was easy to do."
1,The Greatest Rock & Roll Christmas Album Ever!,"Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, not a day goes by that I don't listen to at least one song from this masterpiece, whether I'm at home, on the job, or taking a walk. The best and most original song is Darlene Love's ""Christmas(Baby Please Come Home)"". What it means to me is a plea not just for someone to return to one's life during the Holidays, but for something like friendship or respect to resurface. I know about it all too well, because there were times in my teens and 20s(I'm 46, BTW)when I went into Christmas without respect or a job.I e-mailed Darlene's website a few days ago, and her management team tells me that she will make her annual appearance on the Letterman show December 21 to do her signature Holiday classic. Baby please come home!"
0,How the *@#$ can this hack have a best of release?!?!?!?!?,"Everyone with half a brain knows that the best & only cast of SNL worth watching was back in the late 80's to early 90's with the likes of Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, among others. Every cast before or since has been nothing but a sinkhole of talentless, boring, pathetic losers trying to be something they're not.... funny. The only way any of these people, especially Will Ferrell, could make me laugh is if they fell down a few flights of stairs and broke thier necks. Please, if you are entertaining the idea of purchasing this dreck, do something more constructive with your money... throw it out the window. That's what your doing anyway."
0,morrowind,After speeding home from the store with my new game i just got (morrowind).i could not wait to get it open to play man it looked and sound so cool from the back of the box and some review i look up on the net.But wow they where wrong man this game starts out nice with the way you can pick your guy out and class and traid you what to be but that is it.After that it gos down hill fast to me.1 the fighting is week 2 wen you find a guild and join it it is for nothing but to wast alot of time doing nothing that will mean anything in the game.3 well the bugs dont help out.Well just not what i was looking for it to be after reading the back and trusting some good review sites.BUT the graphics are way cool but i could not tell if i ever got out of the dungeon the game was so dark.
0,Junk,I agree with the vast majority of reviews on this product. It works poorly and I too was here looking to see if I could find a replacement for this toaster. Spend a little more and get a product that works far better.
0,tyler perry's worst movie so far,"I love ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" and ""Why did I get Married"" but this movie lacks in all the aspects of film making. The characters are awful except for Rick Fox's performance and the Mom's son ( unknown). It's not funny at all. It has no heart like his other movies. It's just bad. There's also the annoying Lee Roy Brown and Hispanic lady characters. Bottom line, you are wasting you're money if you buy or even rent this movie."
0,Broke! Junk knife!!,"I owned this knife for less than 6 months, never abused and it BROKE. The opening pin literally snapped from the metal so now the knife won't close.. i opened it less than 500 times.. GARBAGE. Never will buy SOG again."
1,Misses a star for the missing tracks,"5ive is my favorite boyband. Excuse me, *lad* band. I love the fact that they don't sound like most of the other guys out there and they know how to rock every now and then. Too bad the US audience seems to ignore them completely. This CD is pretty good but I've only given it 4 stars because it is missing 4 tracks that are on every other release. It is missing my favorite song, ""Cold Sweat"" and anyone who's heard it can testify to how great it is. My friends and I couldn't stop singing it when we first heard it. If you want 5ive's debut album, try to get an import version. Trust me on this one."
1,decent quality for the price,"decent quality for the price, i have ordered two of these for my daughters. does what it is designed to do hold a gun and keep it from getting dusty and beat up"
1,great book for men,I found this book really helpfull. You can read it and it has some excercises that are helpfull. You can almost immediately feel a SLIGHT improvement after reading the relevant chapters
0,hmmm.....,"this movie was alright. too much of a blaxploitataion film, but otherwise ok. why didnt anyone catch him tho?"
0,offensively inaccurate,shockingly bad. rife with inaccuracies and flat out misinformation (even in cases of recent history like the North Hollywood shootout). terrible writing. really... i'm at a loss...
1,"So far, so good.","I took my daughter out for a ride on the WeeRide for the first time this past weekend. The first words out of her mouth were, ""I like this!""She's 2 years old and about 30 pounds and I was a little nervous as I'm not a great bike rider, but it went fine. To test the WeeRide out, first I put her in the seat, held the handles of the bike, and just walked up and down the street for a few minutes. Then I rode the bike with the WeeRide in place but without her, to make sure I felt comfortable. I realized that her seat got in the way of being able to get off my seat and straddle the bike (i.e., when stopping). I adjusted my bike seat to its lowest setting so that I could stand on my tiptoes while leaning forward from my seat. This isn't a good solution for long bike trips, as now I'm not getting a full leg extension, but it's fine for short trips around town, which is all I'm planning to do at this point.After two years off a bike, I am finally back on!"
1,This book is a must have reference for everyone who mixes drinks,This book is an extremely valuable resource providing detailed recipes on an extensive number of drinks. Providing multiple versions on many of the more popular recipes is a nice bonus. The product information included by the author is interesting and the straightforward drink preparation instructions are also very valuable and helpful.
0,Dusty Shower Curtain,"Upon unfolding this curtain, it was coated in some sort of powdery substance. I have not had many death threats and am I pretty likable person so I knew it wasn't laced with anthrax. The powder because a slime when it got wet, so cleaning my new shower curtain has been a chore. It is a very long shower curtain."
1,solid and good looking,"This tub caddy is solid and very well built. We had another caddy for 10 years and I can already tell this one will be better. We are very pleased. So far we've only had it a few weeks, so I can't comment on how well it holds up to rust yet. We really like having the three sections, but I do wish all three areas were a little deeper. We use the middle section for bath toys, and the side sections for shampoo bottles. I made the mistake of buying shampoo where the bottle is wider at the top, which makes it want to tip over no matter what. In the side section of this caddy, it is guaranteed. This should be easy to fix, I just need to buy different shampoo!"
0,Hmmpphh...,"The illuminated dial is much too bright and positioned off to one side of the face. Kept me awake.It would appear that if the bulb ever burned out, there's no way to replace it.Didn't keep it long enough to find out if the alarm was OK, but had a hunch that it would be unpleasant.Kind of cheesy for the price.Returned it.Larry the M"
0,Worst movie ever,"As others have stated here, this waste of celuloid was rushed out to cash in on the science fantasy/Star Wars craze. It had horrible acting. Horrible special effects that make the old Buster Crabbe serials look like high def masterpieces. A horrible plotline. It was so bad it doesn't even work on a Troma level (and I've seen many of their films). Starcrash (the Adventures of Stella Star) doesn't even qualify as a B-film (more like a Z film?) it was so bad. Save your money!"
0,SKIP THIS BOOK,THIS BOOK HAS A COOL LITTLE DIAGRAM FROM WWII THAT SHOW VITAL TARGETS AND TIME OF DEATH. OTHER THAN THAT THIS BOOK IS USELESS. IT'S JUST A HISTORY OF KNIFE FIGHTING. IT'S ABOUT 90 PAGES OF SOMEONE TELLING YOU THAT SOMEONE ATTACKING SOMEONE ELSE WITH THE KNIFE IS ONE OF THE OLDEST WAYS TO ATTACK SOMEBODY AND IT STILL WORKS TODAY.
1,An absolutely beautiful pen for those who like to write,"This is a beautiful and well made fountain pen that's a pleasure to use by those who still enjoy writing thank-you notes by hand and who appreciate the scratch of a fine nib on fine paper. It's definitely an acquired taste to use a fountain pen, but those who still like to write will know what I mean. The pen looks and feels great in your hand and Waterman refills are still available at most stationery stores and online. This is a definitely a keeper pen."
0,Disappointing,"Perhaps it's understandable that a film 37 years after its release no longer is funny. Juvenile and unimpressive, unfortunately, and severely dated."
1,I love this phone!,"I love this phone! I have had no issues with sound quality or reception what so ever. I use Cingular as my provider and it took a while for me to get both text messaging and web to work as Cingular does not sell this phone and therefore cannot really support it either. They actually gave up after 45 minutes on the phone with me (they were really helpful though), but after playing around with it and using the Nokia site for setting up the phone everything works. I then spent another couple of hours surfing for J2ME applications/games so now I have something to kill time with :) This phone is sweet!!!Brian - San Francisco"
1,How can you resist?,"Its missing In The Garden... and He walks with me and talks with me.But overall this is a wonderful collection.I will not review Elvis voice or singing or religious views... ever. The freak below this review went hog wild and on and on about how Elvis died a sinner.Really? How do you know? Judgement day is God's job... not yours. And if He needs your help... he will ask for it.Thats my little rant there.Its the King folks, he is singing about Jesus. What could be better?Enjoy!"
0,UNSATISFYING PURCHASING,"When the item was received just arond last Christmas, it was polished shiny and the design was really attractive. However, after we used it and washed, we found the silver color truned little dark (not tarnished yet, but it seems like) and some spots look like peeling.Since we threw away the packing box, we felt not to return it. However, if the merchant agreed to accept the return without the box, we would appreciate it. Therefore, they would learn what the problem was. And they may feedback to the factory.Hoping to receive a good reply from the merchant soon."
0,Amazon price is low but still it's not worth it...,"This product is not good at all. It heats up very quickly and things get stuck very easily. I bought this item because price was too good to pass. But after I used it for couple of times, I had to trash it. It's of no use."
1,Life and Love of Dogs,"I thorough enjoyed reading Marley and Me. Josh Grogan has a warm engaging writing style and brings us into his family. He shares with us very tender moments and hilarious antics.I laughed outloud while reading this book and I am not one to do that. I also cried openly at times. If you are a dog lover, you will be able to relate to the stories of Marley.While Josh Grogan is the not the shining example of dog ownership and how to handle specific dog behavior problems, you can tell that he really did love his dog and usually had his best interest at heart. Although I must say I have to question his motives when he returns from Disneyworld and fails to rush to his beloved pets side as he is near death. I know from my personal experience that nothing could have kept me away from my dog at a time like that.All in all I would recommend this book as a quick read that that will bring enjoyment, laughs and tears."
1,A VERY NICE REPRODUCTION,"I just received the cards, and I am very impressed with the quality of the reproduction of the artwork, as well as the stock and finish. Also, the information card is very informative, and adds to the card's overall appeal. I wanted a reproduction like this, and after reading the reviews on this one and the others available on Amazon, I decided on this one as it got the best reviews. I'm glad I did. Thanks!"
0,Poor quality,"Within several days, the sleeves came apart. I stapled them to prevent them from completely separating. Don't buy this product."
0,Don't waste your reading time,"I bought this hoping for some good instruction on exploring S&M. I got nothing. It focuses mostly on the gay side of this lifestyle. I am fine with any sexual preference, but I was hoping for a more ""all-inclusive"" book."
0,Not Very Scholarly for a Self-proclaimed Scholarly Work,Very disappointing. Mostly the author's interpretation and speculation based on personal opinions and conclusions - Examples: Mary and Joseph obviously were quickly attracted to each other and began sleeping together. It was an obscure 'Bethlehem' in Galilee vice the Judean Bethlehem where Jesus was born. Glad that Chilton knows these things as fact.
1,"Brilliant Sound Quality, Brilliant Playing, Incredible Price!","If you are like most people who like classical music, you probably like me, won't really be able to tell if Gould is better than Richter or if Richter is better than Van Cliburn but you do know if you like a tune or not. As many of these previously mentioned performer's works were recorded ages ago on old equipment and hence sound terrible, you are better off getting newer recordings by very competent performers who recorded on much better equipment and in this case DDD quality and at a tiny fraction of the price. This album is an example of this; Bach's Suites Nos. 1 and 2 are probably among his most beautiful pieces and they are admirably performed here by Eugen Duvier and the sound quality is excellent. Great value for money and a great album. Highly recommended."
1,Better than S$x,"Well may not, but my feet are so damn happy in these! I want them in heals, I want every shoe made with this bottom. My feet have never been so damn happy!!!! The most comfortable sandals ever!!! I have tons of flip flops I am sad to think I have to put these away until summer!"
1,Pretty good PPV,"I do not know why so many people thought his PPV was bad. Sure, it wasn't the best PPV of 2008 (which was pretty awesome with PPVs), but it was very good. It sure as hell was better than Survivor Series 07. That PPV was horrid as all the matches were just stuff you have seen before on Raw many times. This PPV has some good matches, in fact the only match I didn't like and knew I was not going to like was the John Cena/Y2J match. WWE needs to keep this PPV with mostly elimination matches. This is the whole foundation of the Survivor Series."
0,Not his favorite toy,"Given as a Christmas gift to 24 month old, 35 lb, grandson. He's an active little guy and loves ride on toys, but he's not very fond of this one. He can get on it easily enough, but it only goes up and down, it doesn't propel itself forward like when we were kids. He prefers his red wagon or Crazy Coupe. Maybe because he can swerve around in those toys.The handle is not comfortable, it stops half around way so my fingers dig into plastic ridges when I pick it up. It was a cinch to assemble, but that's about the onIy positive thing I can say about it. Wish I'd saved my money on this one."
0,Honda Pilot owners: don't buy,"I was under the impression I had to have these for my 2005 Honda Pilot, which does not have crossbars, to use with the Highland soft-sided car top carrier. These bars are supposed to attach to your car using straps and clips, but the clips did not attach anywhere. Even after jury-rigging the straps, the bars still moved around and did not seem very secure. Was glad I purchased the Surelok Tiedown straps. I attached the car carrier straps to the crossbars anyway for a 6-hour trip, and everything worked fine (probably due to the extra tie-downs). But on the trip home, I did not attach the car carrier to the crossbars (attached side-to-side instead), and nothing budged. So if you have an older Pilot, I don't think you need these crossbars for the ""Highland 10391 Kar Pak Rainproof Soft-Sided Car Top Carrier."""
1,Bad Reputation gets a great reputation!,"I have always been surprised at how little radio airplay Joan and her band receive, especially because like more popular bands like Cheap Trick, she too picks catchy melodies you can remember and rocks them up in similar fashion. She has always been ""Rock 'n'Roll"" and this album proves it!The remastering job is very clear and crisp, the vocals better sounding than my original LP, and the bonus tracks make this a real ""keeper"".For anyone looking to introduce someone to Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, this CD along with "" Love Rock And Roll"" are the two to do it with! Buy it, and turn it up!"
1,Great reading,I bought the Kindle edition for a recent vacation trip to the beach. I found it to very interesting and easy to read on the kindle. Learned about this book on another trip to Charleston and couldn't wait to read it!
1,"An excellent book, but not his best.","It's hypocritical for me to simultaneously rush out to buy every Turtledove book (in hardcover yet) when it comes out, and to also suggest that he's spread too thin writing too many books, but I think that's the case. ""American Front"" is an excellent book, one that would do credit to most any writer, but it's not up to Turtledove's high standards. (Note to Publishers: pay him more money so he can spend more time on each book.) This said, I enjoyed the book and read it straight through. It's a first-rate book; it's just that I know he could do better."
1,The lyrics were definitely moving.,I have not heard this song in its entirety but I have heard parts of it twice on the radio. I searched amazon.com to find the artist to go with the title. Any listener would be able to identify some point in his life when he could relate to the words of this powerful song.
0,It's fine if you live in the desert,"What a disappointment! I usually have great luck with Sony products, but not this one. This unit functions so poorly in humid environments that they've actually printed it up in the ""troubleshooting"" section of the manual! I live in the midwest and would come home in the summer and have to turn on the player 30 minutes before use so that the heat of the machine could ""burn"" the condensation off the laser lens. This is how Sony suggests dealing with this flaw! Even then, I could only get it to work 30% of the time. I took it back after a week and got the panasonic equivalent (only w/ 5 dvd changer!) and have been thrilled with it. Unless you live in a low humidity environment DO NOT BUY THIS!"
0,This book tells you essentially nothing about the topic.,"This book is an OK overview of some basic photo software techniques, but really fails to say much about digital photography, that being the use of digital cameras. If you want a book that's mostly about photo editing software you could do much better, and that's the fundamantal point to this book. If you actually want to learn about digital cameras and digital photography look elsewhere, because this book has very little to say on the topic."
0,Cheaply made. Lasted only 2 months,"We purchased this for our daughter who loves to sleep with a light on. she loved this night light and Slept with it every night. The problem is after two months the bulbs burned out and there is no way to replace them. We also purchased a turtle night light for our son and the same thing happened after two months. While the idea is great and the kids love them, these night lots are too expensive to only last 2 months."
0,Shame on Lodge or Amazon?,"I was so looking forward to receiving this 7 Qt. Dutch oven. What a disappointment. This is OBVIOUSLY a SECOND, not first quality. The bottom is not quite level, there's a pin hole size chip on the interior, the lid does not fit at all no matter which way it's turned. I'm not paying to ship it back for exchange because chances are I'd only be shipped another second. Instead, I will NOT BE ORDERING ANYTHING ELSE MARKED ""LODGE ENAMEL"" FROM AMAZON. Yes, the price was a good price. But obviously there is no quality control on this particular product since there's no possibility the lid on this pot could have passed. If Amazon is selling seconds or thirds, THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO STATE THAT A PRODUCT IS A SECOND OR THIRD & let the customer decide if they want to take a chance. IF LODGE IS KNOWINGLY SELLING THEIR SECONDS TO RETAILERS AS FIRST QUALITY, SHAME ON LODGE NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE."
1,"Okay, it's not that bad...","Well, I have to say, I did get irritated with the game when I could get past the last 2 levels. I tossed it aside and didn't touch it for a week. Then I decided to give it another shot and guess what? I finished the game! So, if you didn't like it or couldn't get past it the first time, try again. It may really get you hooked. I know I did. And I didn't even like the movie."
1,"I like this series, so far",I think this is just as good if not better than the first. It adds a bit more background info and is scary.
1,Beautiful,"I'll admit that I loved my Pilot Vanishing Point H1005 pencil, but I finally wore out my last one and it is no longer manufactured. The Pentel Sharp Kerry is a gorgeous replacement, far more elegant than the Pilot and more in keeping with business attire. Moreover, the removable cap is delightful. All in all, this is a lovely pencil."
0,This left sounds bad!,I have been a big fan for many years but I'm very disappointed with this acoustics cd. All the hits re-worked and re-worked pretty bad. Sounds like he is singing from an intercomb. The unplugged era is about over with too. This stuff is so outdated...Buy The Crossroads cd instead if you want their hits...it has the originals.
1,nice book shame about the price,Kluwer seem to have done it again...produced a reasonable book that would be of value to many physicians but sadly way over priced and simply not worth the outlay in hard earned cash...of course they say it's because of the 'high cost of publishing' somehow I find that rather hard to believe. Buy this if money is not important to you.
0,excessively noisy,Returned both of these due to excessive noise. I have built similar units out of computer fans and pvc pipe and they are quiet. I was hoping these would be quiet but they were not.
0,Meh,"There's not a whole lot about this album that hasn't been done a million times before and a million times better. The songwriting is just lackluster, 2-minute bursts of noise with no real direction or enthusiasm. The vocals are incredibly generic. Not to mention the album is only about as long as an EP, and two of the songs are basically instrumental filler. This band's really overhyped, and they fail to deliver on this album. If you want death metal done well, stick to things like Vader or Gorguts. Leave this garbage to the scene kids."
0,"""Vengence is mine!"" sayeth Jon Atack","I read this book already some years ago. It is - as the many others on the subject - full of biased ""information"" and seems to serve only one purpose: The childish revenge of a certain Mr. Atack on an organization which didn't want to deal with his bad manners and deceitful character and threw him out. What else can be expected by apostates?! To get an idea of the scriptures of Scientology I recommend to check for primary literature in libraries, any Scientology organization (There is plenty of them and they can be found in the phone book) or at amazon.com using keyword search ""L. Ron Hubbard""."
0,obviously missed 30 seconds over tokyo,"Would have been a good book if author had merely seen one of my favorite movies ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo""."
1,Great band/Great CD,"On a whim, I left southeast Missouri for the Broken Spoke in Austin, Texas on 3/4/99. On 3/5/99, Friday night, at The Broken Spoke, I had the good fortune of catching The Cornell Hurd Band.These guys were great! I was blown away. I couldn't really call myself a Texas swing fan until I heard these guys rock the house.So knocked out by their performance, I had to buy the Texas Fruit Shack CD & Cornell was gracious enough to sign my copy. Like their live performance, it's a great CD!Take it from this crusty old songwriting/musician of 20 years, these guys are the real deal. If you'd like to expand your horizons & really get into the soul of Texas Honky-Tonk, get this CD. You won't be disappointed. The Cornell Hurd Band is proof that even the most traditional forms of hardcore Texas Swing/Honkey-Tonk is alive & well & ever evolving."
1,Impressed with this newcomer - Jolof Groove,"This CD is really groovin'! A good mix of different musical styles. Really enjoyed the Senegalese percussion, and musicality of the guitarist and singer. This album reminded me of Sting and Peter Gabriel, particularly the songs ""Water"" and ""So the Story Goes"" - but with a whole new twist! I would recommend this CD to any listener no matter what your musical taste, Jolof Groove is definitely the answer!! Can't wait to hear them live and see what new ""grooves"" they come up with!"
1,Product as described,"Fun game to play for every age. Product came in a timely fashion, well packaged. Love the storage tin to keep everything in."
0,Its average,"""No Mercy"" for the N64 is the best wrestling game ever made and this one isn't half the game ""No Mercy"" is. This new ""Showdown: Legends of Wrestling"" is way overrated. After reading so many positive reviews about it, I thought they finally got it right. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Its worth renting for the sake of having King Kong Bundy do a body splash onto Bobby Heenan from the top of a steel cage in Madison Square Garden, but I wouldn't buy it."
0,Just poor quality,"I have been buying ""THE MOUNTAIN"" T-shirts for years, and I will no longer continue to purchase this product as the quality of ""THE MOUNTAIN"" T-shirts has severly deminished to the point it offends me. On reciept of my order, these shirts look nothing like what is posted on amazon, the colors are completely different-of low quality, and the quality of the material is nothing short of a cheap shirt out of mexico."
1,They taste like my mom made them!,"I don't get to eat many cookies but when I do I want them to taste great. You just cannot beat cookies fresh out of the oven for the great taste and the aroma. This mix is nice as you quickly add butter, an egg and bake. In less than 20 minutes you have a nice sweet treat to share with family and friends.My grandson loves to come over and bake some cookies for dessert for dinner. Unfortunately many times they don't last long enough to make it to dinner time. Their life span is pretty short. There is just something about eating them while they are still warm that is just irresistible.Betty Crocker is a good name brand and one you can trust for the highest quality. You should buy some and treat the kids and yourself to something special!"
1,What a Fun Place to Work!,"Empire Records is a local music store that is in danger of becomig a big bad chain - Music Town. This movie follows a day in the life at the store in which a famous singer, Rex Manning, comes to do a signing, and the employees trying to figure out how to save their store. I think what makes this movie work is definitely the character interaction. By the end of the movie you love these characters. I think it's a great fun movie."
0,Not even worth it if its free!,I noticed this book had not been given one star yet so I had to be the first. It is just as terrible and boring as A Separate Peace. If you did not like it you will not like this book. Peace Breaks Out and a Separate Peace should be ritualistically burned and then have their ashes put in a vault and dropped in the deepest part of the ocean or perhaps launched into the sun so no student will every have to bear the burden of being forced to read them.
1,Review for Strictly Ballroom,"Another one of my very favorite movies. I love the fun, quirky characters, and the struggle and finally success to overcome obstacles."
1,Moon Called,I really enjoyed this book. It arrived promptly as promished and was in excellent condition.
1,I had to rent it from Netflixs to watch it because i never received it.,I love Appleseed and the Creator the talented and very cool Masamune shirowsadly when i ordered this dvd set i never received it the seller who used Amazon.comscrewed me over Gohastings screwed me over.But i was able to see it with Netflix!Damn good story.damn good CG.A+ all the way!
0,Leaves hair greasy,"I like to try new hair products from time to time, and decided to give Organix Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum a try. I have shoulder length, medium-thickness hair. I used it twice, and both times it made my hair feel really greasy. The first day, I used one pump's worth and my hair felt really bad all day. The second day I used half as much and got essentially the same results. This was a wasted purchase."
0,Rehash,"I am truly disappointed! This is rehash of songs from previous CD's of Linda's that we all have. There are a couple new songs but unfortunately they are all by FRANK - enough already!!! Linda, you are amazing but PLEASE try a new songwriter. Your voice is too amazing to not expand beyond the Wildhorn songbook series."
1,"The Disciplines of the Christian Life, Eric Liddell (audio book)",Excellent Christian resource. I was both encouraged and challenged by the message. It was well represented in its vocal rendering.
0,Not as big as advertized,"The advertizement said this was a 12"" x 22"" heating pad, but when it arrived, it was only 12 X 14. $40.00 is too much for a small heating pad like this. In all fairness, I have not contactd the seller to see if they would make it right."
1,Another good biography by the D'Aulaires,"This biography of Washington is more detailed -- 3rd through 5th graders will gain a lot of information in a still-fun book. The illustrations and format make this an approachable book for kids who are just getting started with non-fiction reading.Plenty of personal details, like the rules for gentlemen Washington wrote down in his lesson book, and his surverying years, his service in the wars, and his presidency.This is a likable and enjoyable Washington that kids can relate to and respect.Good illustrations."
0,Not for Serious Developers,"This book is lacking for more descriptive code examples. Let's face it,most of us learn from step by step examples, and this is where the book lacks. Theory seems to be lacking also. After going through the book I was not able to write a 3D graphics program without copying the authors code line for line (by the way they did not work either). It talks about general theory but is severely lacking on the details of what each line of code does. Therefore leaving the reader not understanding the core concepts so closing the book and writing a 3D program is not possible."
1,Blaze got power but not the style.,"This is a dark album, and I don't say it for the color. You'll love songs like ""Sign of the cross"" and ""Man on the edge""... But blaze is not exactly what you think.His voice is deeply annoying sometime, but is excellent. THis album deserves a looking.You won't be dissapointed"
0,THESE DISCS ARE TERRIBLE,DO NOT BUY THESE DISCS> NONE OF THE DVDS I BURN WITH THESE DISCS WORK PERFECTLY. THEY ACTUALLY LEAVE OUT CHUNKS OF VIDEO AND BECOME DIGITAL MESSESS ON THE TV. CRAP. BUY VERBATIM AND BURN ON A BURNER THAT DOES REAL x1 not x4 like anything new school you gotta get a dvd burner from 2003 or earlier
1,eye-opening,"Excellent book! Teaches the goal of communicating your feelings & needs, regardless of what someone else wants you to do. The teachings in this book, if used, can disable someone's ability to manipulate. This is a classic."
1,Great Book,"I never thought I would want to incorporate techniques such as basket weaving into my jewelry, but the pictures of woven jewelry in this book are so attractive and the directions so clear, detailed and easy to follow that I thought I'd give it a try. I'm delighted with the results and can't wait to try more of the techniques."
1,Perfect for any pony lover,"This is the cutest pony, she is pnk and has a butterfly on her cutie mark. She comes complete with a butterfly net, three jars and four butterflys to put in the jars. She also has butterfly hair clips. A must have for anyone who loves ponies."
1,Tammy Cochran still pretty good !,"Even though I will always remember her song tribute to her two brothers that passed on, I have the cd but don't remember the exact title without the cd in front of me...I think it is ""Angels in Waiting""? Anyway she still has a pretty voice on this album and the hit song, which is what the title of the album is after is AWESOME and the most memorable for me. It is a catchy tune with a good meaning. All of the songs on the cd she really put her blood, sweat and tears into. It is definately from the heart. I am just so glad she found a new WONDERFUL record label that continues to bring out her beautiful voice in the best possible way. I like it when country artists can put themselves into the music and I love it when they write or co-write the songs, you can tell. Keep up the good work Tammy!"
1,An amazing and invaluable material,"Well, for anyone intersted in pat metheny music, this is it.. no need to search anymore, the book has some biographical information, discography and a list of pat participation in other bands, and then all the partitures in a very nice printing. it really worth it's price"
1,Canon BU-10 Bluetooth Adapter,This is a great product and it's quite convenient while traveling with a laptop.MD
0,A terrible book that fails to appreciate the understandin Africa,"This book is nothing more than a pathetic and inconsistent rant about the minor troubles of a Muslim African woman. It truly fails to incorporate the real pain many extreme Muslim women feel, or the unbelievable suffering Africa is undergoing."
1,Epic concert.,"The concert on the first disc is definitely one of the best, if not the best, Muse concert out there. Splendid performance and quality. The set list feels very complete and amply shows off songs from both Showbiz and Origins. The second disc having a few hours of great behind the scenes videos from the tour. Truly a great buy. However, only four stars because I could not play either DVD in any of my DVD players, could only play them through my computer (Although I did not try a game system)."
1,Thought I already reviewed this one.,"But they say I didn't so I have nothing negative to say. If it's the right memory for your computer, don't hesitate to buy it. Works fine."
0,Starcade Dissapoints,"This was suppossed to be the biggest WCW PPV ever....instead it ended up being one of the most dissapointing. The main event was a huge letdown. It was very screwy and not executed properly. Not enough good cruiserweight matches to balance the flow of the show. Too many heels went over the babyfaces in an event where most of the faces should have went over. Several wrestlers no-showed this event as well. I have no idea why a 3 1/2 year old tape is being sold for ... when it was ... to see it live. It may be worth a look because of its historical value, but please don't plop down ... for it."
1,A nostalgic trip to the past!,"This is a vintage album by Latin pop diva Yolandita Monge. We have to note that her early style differs markedly from the style that would characterize her later songs, as is evidenced by ESTILO Y PERSONALIDAD. An amazing performance, nevertheless! My favorites in this album include VIDA and PORQUE DISTE VUELTA A LA CARA. Although at times Yolandita can be quite charismatic in her songs, I feel that sometimes, she puts just a bit much of an emphasis on emotion. However, this CD gives us a great glimpse into her early style. I would heartily recommend it! A great addition to any Yolandita Monge collection!! Kudos to the diva!!!"
1,BASIC AND EXCELLENT,"When I listen to a CD, I'm focused on four basic elements: The production, the vocal performances, the lyrics, and the instrumentation. Production is clear, crisp, and a sonic treat. Vocals are great and match up perfectly w/the songs and lyrics. The harmonies are outstanding. Lyrically, there will be two types of listeners -- those who can relate, and those who are in denial. As far as instruments go, these guys (and a girl) are world class. As far as the comments I've read about them "" . . . not finding their voice . . . "" or "" . . . needing a theme . . . "", I have no idea what they're talking about. THe CD is snapshots of life, very basic, and excellent. Get it!"
0,deceptive,when investigating this product I was looking for what is described so was purchased. upon arrival very dissapointed due to the fact that the product dementions were the size of the box not the product itself. so buyers beware you get regular cheap sized dominos so dont waste your money. I wist I hadnt. infact I think it will go back.
1,Great watch for a great bargain,All functions are similar to my last ironman watch which after four years just quit on me. The band is solid and it makes for a great replacement.
0,"Great Idea, Bad execution","They thought of a great idea. Extremely convenient push button top that you can drink from any side. Unfortunately, they use some of the cheapest plastic around to construct the lid which is easy to break. If they used stronger materials, I would easily recommend this product to all, but unfortunately, the cheap plastic sets it back. I dropped mine once, and that was the end. Shattered the lid into a billion pieces. On the other hand, I have dropped and banged my THERMOS mugs and they are still in working condition."
1,Sweet & Romantic,"This is a sweet and romantic movie, and I suggest it to any romantic-movie-lovers. I don't exactly suggest this movie for teen boys, they may find it too ""mushy."""
0,Disappointing,"If you already know how to write an outline for an essay and you know how to brainstorm then this book isn't worth your time or money. Mind maps are just outlines that include creativity; drawing pictures, pictograms and writing themes on branches radiating out from the center of the page."
0,So boring they won't watch it,"You are better off getting some simple flash cards. My 2 1/2 year old grandson cries and runs from the room when I put one of these dvd's in to play. Leap frog keeps him interested, so its not because its a learning video, I believe its the format. The video dispays a word and then says it, over and over again. Sometimes there is a little animation but its confusing because the animation has nothing to do with the word. Big waste of money. There has to be a better way out there to teach sight words."
1,SEXY COWBOY,"I really enjoyed this book! Fate brings about a chance meeting between Harden & Miranda, and the opportunity for 2 sad people to make each other happy - in the usual sexy Diana Palmer style. Well worth reading, as is ""Evan"" and ""Connal"", Harden's brothers' stories."
0,How un-original,"I have not read this book, and could not give it a 0,but the reviews say enough. It is insulting, as a silent-film buff to see ""America's Sweetheart"" under a picture of Julia Roberts...sure, she's a great actress of OUR times, but Mary Pickford will always be remembered and live on through her art of film as the original ""America's Sweetheart."" Anyone who knows of Pickford's astonishing work will agree she set a new standard in film, and it is a shame her pictures are not more readily available on DVD. Some available on Amazon are: Stella Maris, Daddy Long Legs, Little Annie Rooney, Tess of the Storm Country, and My Best Girl. Also Highly recommended is Eileen Whitfield's Biography, Pickford:the woman who made Hollywood. For the record, I have nothing against Julia Roberts, but I can't stand such unoriginality in a title. Julia Roberts has always reminded me of a gorgeous homecoming Queen, who happens to be a very talented (and popular)actress in her own right."
0,Don't advise getting,"I bought this item thinking that it would connect to my new mini ipod and it doesn't. I have written them several emails and they won't write back, there is no number to reach them at, and they say you can return it within 30 days but you aren't able to return it without an approval from them first...which there is no way to get ahold of!"
1,Beautiful watch,It is a beautiful casual watch. I have a small narrow wrist and it fits perfectly. Great price.
0,the slower picker upper,to thin to actually use to dry off with... colors are nice and vibrant... would make a nice poster
1,Outstanding,"Nothing less than outstanding. Her sound is so pure and amazing, everytime I hear this CD, it continues to get better. My favorite song on this album is ""East of the Sun"" and I was lucky enough to hear her sing this song live at the Hollywood Bowl and LET ME TELL YOU, she sounds great in person. If you like smooth jazz, you will appreciate Diana Krall. Diana is one of the newer artists that really distiguishes herself from the rest of the pack. This CD never gets old."
0,Waste of a precious Saturday. Completely Pointless.,"I spent the better part of my day reading this book and now wish I had chosen something else to read. It is so strange that at first it draws you in and then it quickly becomes one of those books that you keep reading because you know there just has to be a point...some deeper meaning...there isn't. This book is senseless, and often disturbing. Every character in the book is deeply disturbed, and the plot is pointless and often upsetting. I love to read and I feel this book stole a day that could have been spent with a book worth reading, because this one definitely is not."
0,this DVD is pathetic !!!!,"Having remembered this on VHS from years ago you would have thought that this DVD would have been remastered or something of an upgrade at least from video tape. However it is NOT, it is absolute crud ! Poor video & audio quality all round not even worthy of 1 star. A very poor release don't waste your money. Francis the talking pig deserves better than this."
0,Just OK,"***Edit***Flipped my kayak over while the whistle was attached to the shock cording in front of the cowl to dump out the water. The whistle must have hit a rock, because it split in three pieces. I would expect a safety whistle to be a bit more durable. Lowering the rating to two stars.*********Not a bad whistle for the price. Not as loud as I was hoping, and it's extremely difficult to vary the volume with your air flow. I keep this clipped to my PFD when kayaking, and I was hoping to give short signaling chirps to the other boats. It's pretty much all or nothing, and all isn't all that loud."
0,"Very disappointing, and hardly worthy of the Star Wars name.","There is so much interesting work that could have been done with John Williams' excellent source material... but this group chose instead to simple hack Duel of the Fates into unintelligible and repetitive music-kibble. The music is hardly listenable, let alone dance-able. With all the outstanding movie-theme remixes to be found these days, this one is hardly worth your effort or money. You will be dumber for having listened to it. Just stick to the original version of Duel of the Fates... available on Sony Classical."
1,compatible toner cartridge for HP 12A,This B&W toner cartridge is acceptable as a replacement cartridge for HP 12A. Its copies are of standard quality and the price is right.
1,Both a legal and political thriller,"It is unique to come across a book that is both a legal and political thriller, but that is what Brian Haig has accomplished in his latest work. The book is full of unanticipated plot twists and political and military conspiracies. The lead character, Major Drummond, is both aggressive and irreverent, which I found refreshing in this genre. He uses these uses qualities to look past the calm and organized setting and ferret out the turbulent and ugly reality beneath.The book cleverly develops complication upon complication,generated by one disobeyed order, and leading ultimately to an intractable disaster. I found this book to be a bold and extraordinary thriller full of suspense and surprise. A wonderfully satisfying read."
0,"""Takes a licking, then stops ticking""","You may have seen this quote elsewhere in relation to this watch.It is very stylish, easy to use and feels very solid. I especially liked the weight of the watch and metal band.The analog portion of the watch stopped after less than 9 months.To be fair, I tend to wear a watch 24/7 and I swim, ride my bicycles in all weather and generally don't stop to take off a watch before any activity.After the watch failed, I did some research to see if any others had the same experience and it appears this watch has an issue with the analog portion dying after 1-3 years.Wonder if they'd consider a toggle between digital numbers and digital hands?"

0,unhappy,"I was not pleased at all with my purchase. The idea was suppose to be in excellent condition, but the last page was riped out."
0,Book Of the year? Disappointment of the year!,"I bought this book to read on holiday, persuaded by recommendations on the cover that it was one of the Books of the Year 1997 for several newspaper reviewers. I found the repetive style of the book irritating, although I appreciate the allusions to mazes and particularly the 'revelation'at the ending. However, the content was sooo boring! I read the whole of the book - hoping it would get better. Although Larry was a pretty nice guy, at the end I resented the fact I had wasted so much time on such a Joe Average that let life wash over him and then had his mislife crisis! There were some funny moments, good character observations and I learnt some interesting things about mazes(!) so I might try another Carol Shields novel but I would definately NOT recommend this book nor believe the hype."
1,Review from Books That Heal Kids,"As a school counselor, I love using books that have humor in them to deal with universal issues. The author does a great job of balancing this humor while defining 'worry' for children. Is A Worry Worrying You gets kids to open up. More than ever before, children are WAY overstressed. As I read the story, I will here from my audience:I'm worried my parents are getting divorced.I'm worried my brother is going to beat me up.I'm worried about my new stepsister.The book does offer strategies but it also hints at not letting these worries through the door in the first place. Love that."
0,I could not finish this book!,I cannot stand the main female character in this book. She is impossible to understand and I couldn't stomach to read anymore of her. Jamie deserved way better than getting stuck with her. I will not finish it... I will pretend that he gave her to the Indians so that he could find the happiness that he deserves.
1,The Kindle,"I recently bought a Kindle Wireless Reading Device. I absolutely love it! I have already read several books and it was very easy to use. I love the ""dictionary"" feature where you can easily click on a word and instantly get the definition. I have learned so many new vocabulary words because it is so easy to use. I also love the ability to change the font to larger print. Reading has never been easier. Being able to download a book any time of the day or night is also so convenient. I have nothing negative to say at this point. I love my Kindle!"
0,No comment,"This man is a fraud and he's only after your money. You can prove this in three steps!First one : Go to Yahoo.com or Google.comSecond step : Type his name under "", (""Benny Hinn"" fraud) and click enterThird step : Read one of the hundreds articles written about what I've just said.In the other side of the coin if his b.sh. helps people for real then it doesn't really matter. I mean who wouldn't buy happiness or health for money, even if that money goes to a dishonest man.But if you're in doubt before making $100 min. donations to this pastor, be absolutely sure that Benny Hinn would be the last person God would chose to spread His messages around.Did you also know that this Benny Hinn inspired Steve Martin's movie ""Leap of Faith""? There you can see how mikes, computers and an enormous group of people work for him."
0,It does not show a lot of Ricky and the facts are inaccurate,This video is a waste of money. The quality is horrible and there is not a lot of Ricky footage. It's all interviews and trying to give inaccurate facts on the hottest musical talent today. I was really disappointed. No wonder this video was not authorized by Ricky nor his management.
1,Private Eyes,This movie is hilarious! We owned this movie as a VHS and the whole family loved it. I bought this as a birthday gift for our 28 year old who loved it as a child and was wanting to buy it herself. She was so excited when she opened the gift!
1,sturdy,I was a worried about this case because some of the reviews said it was too small for a camera. I purchased a Canon t3i w/ the 75x300 lens it all fit great with enough room for another lens or two. I personally like it because it is big enough for all my stuff but small enough to bring with me everywhere.
0,buyer beware,i was somewhat shocked at the size and quality of the products. considering the price i am suspect. i do not think they would be 19 dollars at a store.
0,Battletoads review,"THIS SHOWS STINKS TO THE 25th POWER. A lame attempt to cash in on fame of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. The cast & the villains are bland & cliche. Even more then Batman & Robin if you can belive that. The action is silly & childish. Even The Carebears Movie had better action then this. The lines & battle cries like ""Let's get Worty"",""Cosma-riffic"" & ""psychotronic"" are dumb and made me wish for the jokes from Milton The Monster. The story is luke-warm at best. I seen better stories on TNA Impact. The animation is choppy ala Pound Puppies:The Legend of Big Paw. The music sounds like it came form the 50's instead of the 90's. The ending is a rip-off because no network in their right mind pick this crud up as a regular series. Overall:If you ever see this tape,BURN IT!!!I gvie this tape a 0 out of 10."

0,Don't Start with This One,"If you're new to VBA, as I was, don't make the same mistake I did. This book is definitely not what I was hoping for. Very unorganized for a starter book, and not much good content. The book from the Wrox group is MUCH better."
1,Informative history of man-made diamond,"In this book Mr. Hazen presents a comprehensive, interesting, and fair history of the development of synthetic diamond. His treatment of some of the controversial historic elements is even-handed and accurate and he presents complex scientific information in a way that is easy to understand. This book is a must read for anyone interested in high pressure research and a you'll-be-glad-you-did for anyone interested in science at all."

1,Canine Body Language,"This book was so inspiring to me as a dog trainer that I base a lot of my observations around dogs on this book. It is a guide to help you better understand your dogs body language as English is not their first language.It is a very thick and big book so it does not read quickly, but can be used as a great reference as a trainer or pet dog owner to better under stand what they are communicating to us and other dogs."
0,Decent Picture But No Zoom,"For the price this is a decent LCD, it looks nice, has a good picture, excellent variety of inputs but it also has a lousy remote and at least one major flaw that ruins it for me. The LT32HVE, and it seems all the LCDs from Syntax, lacks a zoom function to make 4:3 letterboxed sources fill the screen, ie anything shown widescreen on SD cable or broadcast TV as well as some DVDs, VHS and VCDs. You either have to watch with bars on all 4 sides of the picture or stretch the picture to fit the width, leaving the bars top and bottom unchanged and distorting the image. Also, the Olevia logo is very bright blue when the TV is off so it's not good for in a bedroom, unless you like sleeping with a night light."
0,Never got to use it!,"If rating a ""no star"" was possible, that's what it really deserves. I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams! Beyond patching! Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it. I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product. How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump??? That's like blowing it up by mouth!"
0,Looks good but won't play them all,"I purchased this DVD player in Dec of 2006. The machine sets up easily and the picture is great, when it plays the DVD. I have come across 2 new releases that this machine would not play. I contacted Phillips and all they could say was that the machine would not play the new ""dual-layer"" discs and no firmware upgrade would be offered. My asceessment seems to be that this machine was manufactured a couple of years ago and they are no longer offering any supports or updates."
0,"Boring, slow",I did enjoy the flashbacks - they told a good story. The current storyline about the campaign was very boring. It was all I could do to get through this one.
1,EVE 6 Grows up,"This cd is incredible. Their lyrics are much more mature than their last album, ""Horrorscope"". The song topics range from suicide, cheating lovers, and the corruption of big city. Every song is a sing-along pumped with awesome guitar riffs and Max Collin's smooth voice. ""Hey Montana"" is one of the most unique songs on the cd. It sounds like a campfire song. The others like the radio single ""Think Twice"" are classic EVE 6 rock songs with some punk sprinkled in. Die hard EVE 6 fans will definitly be satisfied with this album. This cd is also good for people who are new to EVE 6's music. Bottom Line: BUY IT, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!"
0,Probable Boredom,"If you choose to read this anemic novel, your probable future is several hours of wasted time. The characters hold possibility, but are woefully underdeveloped, the plot is predictible, contrived, and often silly, and neither the ""magic"" nor the ""mystery"" have any depth.A small strain relating the story of 18th century Rebecca Sparrow has some interest, but the storyline concerning this character is brief. Mostly the story centers around a sullen, selfish 13 year old, her dysfunctional relatives, and her romantic fantasies. A young girl in 7th - 10th grades may enjoy this book. It is at the reading level and literary depth suitable to jr. high school."

0,A Childrens book with cutout domes.,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book. It is not an architectural treatise, it's a children's book with cutouts that let you make a paper model. If you want a good book on the architecture of Geodesic Domes, buy a biography of Buckminster Fuller."
1,"Fine scores, beautiful performance","This is a classic. There are a few recordings of LeJeune's Le Printans but with no doubt this is the most perfect recording ever, not only about LeJeune's repertoire but about renaissance french chansons."
1,I think you should buy this book,"I cannot improve on any of the summaries written already on this page. I will just add my recommendation. I think everyone should read this book. Itis moving,it is entertaining,and it is very well written."
0,And Only to Deceive,"The only suspense in this book is what favors it took to secure the glowing grace notes. If the plot or narrative generate suspense, it is only momentary. The mystery here is not about Victorian art thefts, but about what makes an audience. Presumably someone enjoyed this thoroughly trite, contrived, and transparent novel. Presumably some editor forsaw that this audience existed. And in a world teeming with aspiring authors, that is quite an achievement. Mysterious."
1,awesomely awesome,words can't explain how much this CD rocks. the music is different from their other stuff which i LOVE because i'm sick of bands (like linkin park & dashboard confessional) whose music all sounds the same. i went to sugarcult's show two days ago & they didn't disappoint me whatsoever. palm trees & power lines is definately a CD i'm recommending to EVERYONE.
0,Still Waiting,"I would have liked to receive this item as I had ordered it. However, the shipper decided to ship me a different pattern."
1,solid,"i'm a little embarrased at how bothered i am by the amazon review of this album. the time signatures (not that odd) will please most mature listeners. If Sting is self indulgent, i cant imagine what she thinks of sugar ray, puff daddy, etc. Brand New Day isn't supposed to be autobiographical. this is a solid album."
1,"A great ""who done it"" and ""who's next?"" !","This Father Koestler murder is a great read! Not only does the mystery itself keep you hopping, the anecdotes about the church and its very human population provide an interesting backdrop for the action that all of Kienzle's books share. I strongly recommend it (but don't be too disappointed if you don't figure out the puzzle ahead of the famous father)!!"
1,Is always a pleasure to deligth with Donald Fagen tracks,"Once I heard about the new release I have ordered. After the first listen to the work, I felt a little bit frustrated; but as it happens with the best albums, the perception of the work goes up everytime I listen, and now I place it at a similar level of previous works.Joan"

0,"Mouse defective, Microsoft support worse","I purchased two of these mice. One worked as expected, with full functionality. The other didn't. On the defective mouse, the scroll wheel worked, the right button worked intermittently, but the pointer wouldn't move. The defective mouse didn't work (same behavior) on two different computers (one XP and the other Windows 7). The ""working"" mouse was functional on both computers.When I contacted Microsoft, I learned that the ""product id"" was ""expired"" and that it would cost me $35 to even speak with support.I'm going to purchase a non-Microsoft mouse."
0,Phoney and silly,"The author knows very little about Viet Nam or the army. He apparently thinks the 60 in M-60 stands for .60 cal. and that soldiers put stamps on their letters when they were in the war zone. A patrol goes out without a radio, a soldier calls a latrine a ""bathroom,"" and the final bit of silliness---soldiers fly back to the states not on a jet transport, nor on a C-130, but on a C-47, a two-engine prop job built in the 1930s and never used in the Viet Nam War to fly across the Pacific.If Myers paid a vet to check the book for inaccuracies, he did not spend his money well.Because of the dialogue, the book's subtitle could be The Little Rascals Go To War. Soldiers' talk in this book is often too cute. For those who like mildly homoerotic war stories that little reflect the way things are, this book might be for you."
0,Casual fans beware.,"If you are a casual Boss fan, than this album is probably better off being avoided. It's overly dark and moody, and the sound quality is not there. However, the album has good songs, six of the albums' ten tracks appear on the ""Live"" set, and they all sound much better in that format. I specifically found ""Racing in the Street"" and the title track to be significantly better live. Yes the album is deep and somewhat poetic lyrically, but it is missing the chugging ""cars and girls and Saturday night"" songs that are easier on the commercial ear. Die hard Boss backers point to this collection as a near masterpiece, I look at it as a step back."
0,What's he selling?,"This book seems to be more of a 200 page ad for Sheets than anything else. There are some entertaining elements and a little handicapping, but overall he seems to be stroking his ego and taking shots at Beyer's methods. The book is more of a commentary on Ragozin's life than insight into his methods."

1,Viva Corelle!,"This our 3rd set of Corelle. We decided to ""retire"" trusty old Winter White and get something more colorful to go with our kitchen remodel. We considered Fiesta because of the great colors but when we checked it out the pieces were very expensive and very HEAVY. So the spouse and I checked out Corelle patterns and found Watercolors.The pattern is beautiful and the colors are more vibrant than when viewed online. We are keeping all our white serving bowls and platters to go with it but will probably buy new ones in the future in different colors. Our only complaint is that the cereal bowls are too wide and too shallow. We will probably keep our old white cereal bowls as they are the perfect shape.Corelle is unbelievable--We've broken 3 pieces in 30+ years and never have to worry about putting it in the dishwasher or the microwave, or about scratching."
1,My favorite Spanish resource by far,"You need to have a basic knowledge of Spanish to really get the most out of this book. However, if you have that, this book goes a long ways towards solidifing all those grammar rules and verb conjugation that you've been grappling with. The best thing about the book is that it's just plain fun to read. You're learning Spanish, but it feels like you're just kicking back and reading the funnies."
0,Horribly Undersized,I knew A Byer clothes ran small so I ordered a 3 instead of my usual 1. I received the product and the pants would fit a 10 year old. Far to short in length and poorly made.

We were notified that they had been shipped, and given an arrival date approximation, but they never arrived. A few weeks later, we received an email from Amazon telling us that the item was out of stock and that we would have the cost refunded. We did receive the refund. We wish we had been told at the outset that the item was not available."

1,Perfect Pouff!,"I recently cut my hair and have found these brushes perfect to style my new hairdo. The large flat brush is great for lifting the roots and getting most of the moisture out of my hair. Next I go to the small round and turn under my short ends. Last I use the large round to give lift and body to the crown. My hair dries and styles quickly. I don't know if the Tourmaline is the real deal or just marketing, but I have to say that my hair does look shiney."

0,"Smells awful, Time consuming, and take hair out","I bought this first from walgreens, and when I used it it seem to very gradually loosen my hair. Since it was natural , I kept using it but my hair seem to be getting shorter. I thought it was my imagination, however when my Mother told me I lost two inches. I knew it was real. It ONLY straighten my hair about 5 percent and it took out my hair. I could have got a relaxer at that rate which only takes about an hour."
0,Missing pages,"The original writing was wonderful and Twain, of course, deserves 5 stars. However the edition I received, which was printed by Oxford World Classics, was missing pages 123-154. Luckily, I could go on line and actually read those pages (chapters 21 through 25) but that did not make up for the hole in the book that is now part of my library. Very disappointing! This is a classic I had hoped to pass on to the younger members of my family.I rated this edition 2 stars (rather than 1 star) because it did include Twain's ""The Raftsmen's Passage"" in an appendix as a bonus."
0,Very disappointed,"We ordered this as a Christmas gift for our son. Thankfully we opened it so we could load music on it so he could use it right away. When we tried to load music, it would get stuck after every song. We would have to power it off and then try again. After 2 hours of trying we gave up and requested a refund!"
0,No mid range and iPod dock doesn't work,"Shipped very quickly, got it with Amazon Prime next day, which I was happy about, but the PA itself is weak. it doesn't seem to have any midrange power and the iPod dock on top doesn't work at all. All I get is popping and crackling and just a hint of music once I finally get my iPod touch plugged in (which in itself is a bit of a pain), even if I turn it all the way up. Also seems like it is a refurb, though not marked as one, as the warranty seal was broken when it arrived."
1,This is one helluva pop CD!,"This is really what you can call pure, solid pop. The songs make you wanna dance especially Bouncing Off The Ceiling (Upside Down). After amazing folks with The Abba Generation, A*Teens are back. Ask any kid if they can resist this. I thought they wouldn't do that well in their second album as they did on their first but how wrong I was. Buy this CD and you'll be dancing soon enough!"
1,Michael Jackson's Invincable...,"I did not know what to expect with Jackson's latest release, Invnicable.Though I think it is a good CD, I think it sounds like Michael is trying to fit in with a ""younger"" pop world thus making the album sound almost ""artificial"".Maybe I feel this way with this album because of the hype...or the fact that he tries to outdo himself and ran out of ideas thus going with trend rather than his own genius talent as far as production goes. Sure it sounds superb, but like I said...too much like a copy of some of today's artists.The opening 3 tracks as well as the hit ""You Rock My World"" are the highlights for me.There are a lot of ""mellower"" tunes on the second half of the disc which echo a lot of the ""Heal The World"" vibe, but on here it just seems monotonous or out of place. I don't know.Bottom Line: The first MJ album I've heard where I didn't have a ""great feeling"" when I was through listening to it. Another point: It doesn't help that it was over 75 minutes long I think."
0,fool me once.. shame on u.. fool me twice.. shame on me,this is the last ministry of sound cd i will buy. almost all the songs on cd 1 are just endless boring loops of synth and drums. if a club actually played this music people would be heading for the door. there are only two songs worthwhile in the whole set. i would pass on this mess.

0,Noble Effort Falls Short,"Deepa Mehta is a gifted director, and her previous work is highly noteworthy (""Earth"" being the most obvious example). But this was a disappointment on practically every level. The timing and delivery of the actors was awful, dialogue was canned, and production values fell short. Examining the cliches of both Bollywood and Hollywood and looking at South Asians in Toronto in a wry, self-reflexive way is a great idea, but the movie was so awful that none of that was achieved. Noble effort, but believe me, you don't want to waste two hours of your life watching this. Hopefully it was just an anomaly and her next one will make up for it (and she is genuinely talented, so there's no reason to think it won't)."

Finally discovered (after 3 phone calls), Tiger Claw sub-contracts with a distributor who apparently mailed the wrong item, because no poly/cotton hakama are available at the advertised price. Distributor agreed to refund money, upon return of item. Item was returned two months ago; my account has not been credited as of this time. And they are still advertising the poly/cotton hakama."
1,"""Classics and Trash""","A witty and accessible argument for the enduring necessity of Shakespeare, Milton, and many of the other ""greats""--not just because English teachers SAY they are great, but because popular culture from ""Star Trek"" to ""Jurassic Park"" keeps them alive andwell. If you set yourself free from the tyranny of chronology, Hawkins argues famously, ""King Kong"" can influence your reading of ""King Lear"" just as much as the other way around.Hawkins was cultural studies before cultural studies was cool, and her work is ripe for a reassessment."

0,What were they thinking?,"Ok, let's think of the most horrific event of our times and rehash it for the children.I just want to know WHAT were they thinking.My boy picked this out at the library because he loves all things cute and fuzzy. We came home to delve into a re-creation of hell on earth. My kids don't know about what happened on Sept. 11th, so for them it was just another book poorly written (especially when unbeknownst to them I'm editing and censoring on the fly, leaving key information out of the story...perspiring over whether brave mole would be going home to baby mole and how I'd explain that one). As for the kids who know what transpired on that fateful day, I say,""Why put it in fuzzy-wuzzy form and force them to relive the horror?""I understand the need to artistically express the pain and emotion of what happened, but can we not subject the kids to the wars of their fathers? At least until they can understand what it all really means. Ugh."
0,Product Has Changed,I initially purchased this product in 2008 and have used my eTrex Vista HCx mounted on my bicycle's handlebars for the last 2-1/2 years. The snap on the plate that fits into the back of my eTrex broke the other day. I looked up my previous order in Amazon's records and reordered the exact same item. The new piece is almost all plastic and DOES NOT FIT my device. Amazon even suggests this item as an accessory to the eTrex Vista HCx. The Vista HCx has a slot for a memory card for loading mapping data. The space occupied be the slot prevents the back plate from mounting. I do not recommend this product to anyone with an eTrex Vista HCx.

This has happened with several different DVD's and occasionallyif we keep trying something, it will work when it did not work onetime before. After we discovered the problems, we tried to contact Apex (fkor 3 months), but we never got in touch with them.The Customer support telephone number is always busy, and they do not answer their web customersupport."
1,It kicks,"In my opinion, it's about the best cd I've ever heard. Daniel gets really emotional on all the songs, which I think is so cool. The lyrics are deep and they actually mean something, not to mention that they were actually written by the singer, which is rare these days. Frogstomp and Freak Show don't even compare to Neon Ballroom. It's not as hard or edgy as the other two, but its lyrics have a lot more meaning, because Daniel wrote about his own experiences and feelings."
1,Wolves--Endangered or Dangerous?,"As a photographer and retired psychologist I am fascinated by human behavior and more recently attitudes about wolves. Over the last few years my husband and I have spent several weeks during the winter in Yellowstone. We began photographing wolves after noticing the numbers of wolf watchers who huddled with their scopes watching the animals. We began to understand their behavior and how the reintroduction to Yellowstone balanced the ecology. We also realized after our visits, how many people feared and/or hated wolves. Naturalist R.D. Lawrence addresses these issues in a thorough way, making a good case for the preservation of the wolf. His opinions reflect what we have experienced first-hand. He explains why the hybrids (wolves bred with dogs or coyotes) have given wolves a bad name. Agree with it or not it? I do--It should be read."
0,D-12 bring hip-hop to its knees with its new album,"D-12 continues in the venues of Eminem with their bangin' beats, flowin' rhymes, and touchy subjects. While not as polished as Eminem's earlier work in The Slim Shady LP and The Marshal Mather's LP, The Devil's Night contains the same bumping bass and harsh lyrics that made Eminem so famous. The album suffers a bit without Dr. Dre's genius at the boards but manages to convey the same raw emotion as Eminem's first two records. While not a classic, it should easily tide those Slim Shady lovers over until Eminem releases his own new album later next year."
1,Enjoyable Reading,"This is another in Mr. Pears' art history series featuring an Italian art police woman and English art historian/dealer. Unlike the prior books, this one takes place in Los Angeles rather than Rome. The change in venue does not detract.The Bernini Bust is one of the more enjoyable of the series.Is there a bust or not? Is it a forgery or not? At least the reader is sure there was a murder early on in this thoroughly enjoyable novel.Mr. Pears' all-to-human heroes go through their usual mistakes and miscues and end up solving the crime. There is also a bit of shaving the ethical edges that always adds an interesting twist or two to these books.What adds to this series is that Mr. Pears keeps the characters - and their relationship - developing. He also adds humor - one can imagine that when Mr. Pears writes about Argyll and Flavia he does so with a wry grin.There's no heavy-lifting in these books, but this book, like the others is a great light, quick read."

However, I am absolutely appalled by the fact that Ann MacPherson would give away the ending of this incredible book!!What was this woman thinking, first off??

Rethink and delete her review before she ruins this book for absolutely everyone.Bad call on both her and amazon.com's part."

0,Upset my stomach,"These upset my stomach for some reason. It didn't seem to matter whether I took them with food or not. This might be TMI, but it gave me stools like water every time I took one. Your results might differ, but if you get an upset stomach while taking this, you might want to see if this is the cause. I do however love Rainbow Light's Women's Multivitamin. It's the only multivitamin I've tried that doesn't upset my stomach."
1,No Surface Mount Hardware,"I bought these because I wanted to mount them on a wooden deck and they were the only ones I could find that said ""surface mount optional"". If they are indeed ""surface mountable"", there is no hardware in the package to do that. I contacted Intermatic/Malibu and after a week or so they sent me an email suggesting that they may have accessory parts that you can buy from them to surface mount these lights. If you plan to surface-mount these, be aware that you can't do it with the supplied hardware, you might be able to order accessory parts to do it, and if the accessory parts do exist, it will take forever to find and order them.I was able to mount my lights in a hanging position without the parts, so ultimately I was satisfied with the product."
0,This should not have been an Amazon recommendation,"After reading Vinegar Hill, I expected a lot more insight and subtlety from this book. It was not to be found. I thought the description of these middle America, middle income types were trite and often cruel. Do people like this exist? Of course they do. But to make a blanket statement about a whole group is grossly unfair. It should not be assumed that people who don't have much money necessarily have poor taste. The bride's gown was a little much! Amazon recommended this book. Shame on you!"
0,"Good Cast, Poor Writing, Defies Logic Then Tried to Get Political","This was a show I really wanted to succeed since I really liked the cast but poor writing, really impossible situations that were never explained and then the Pro-Gun Control rant (which served no purpose for the show) just ended it for me. When you allow poor writers to inject their political views into a script for no reason other than letting them air their political tendencies I give up! Maybe they should bring back Moonlight since this show may survive this season but in the long run it is gone."

1,Please write a Sequel!!!,"There is this Jewish boy named Daniel, who lived in the holocaust time. The story starts out with him going through his pictures from the past while he is on a train with his family going to a ghetto. Before the holocaust Daniel had a wonderful life. But then Hitler issued for all Jewish people to wear something that lets everyone know that you were Jewish. When they get to the ghetto everything starts to go wrong.I like this book. It was very exciting and some what scary. It was scary because of everything he went through. You don't think about how it was back then. But overall it was a great book if you like a book about the sadness and realness of a story. I could not put this book down."
1,Stories of courage and spiritual insight,"Katherine Martin's Women Of Spirit gathers stories of courage and spiritual insight from the women who lived unusual lives.

1,Funny Yet Serious,"Bongwater's Kramer's second solo album combines, tounge in cheek, and often over-the-top lyrics, with some of Kramer's most clean and complex production. The comparatively minimal use of reverb in the production of this Shimmy-Disc complements the 'comedy' well."
0,-Holden +Phoebe,"Hated this book. This '""coming of age"" book was unfathomable to a teenage girl. Why is this the standard, and beloved book? I felt alienated from the main character and his trifling saga. Worst book I had to read in high school. The only character I cared about was Phoebe--who would have made a much more interesting read for me. Her pain of dealing with her stupid brother was more real than the rest.Good news, though, is this book is increasingly less relevant to 21st century high schoolers. It's becoming a quaint view of the 60s to them, No kidding,"
1,Shadows Fall Have Perfected the Art of Balance.,"When one hears a band like Shadows Fall, they would usually associate them with Gothenburg, home of bands like At The Gates and In Flames. However, Massachusett's own Shadows Fall have the Gothenburg sound down to a science. With ""The Art of Balance"", Shadows Fall have effectively balanced clean and heavy, whether it be the vocals or the music itself, in such a way, that it is truly enjoyable to listen to. After hearing their sophomore effort, Of One Blood, I decided Shadows Fall was a band to keep my eye on. After hearing The Art of Balance, I knew my feelings about this band were right. In Flames fans that are disappointed with ""Reroute to Remain"" would be doing themselves a favor to pick up a copy of ""The Art of Balance"".Key Tracks:Thoughts Without WordsStepping Outside the Circle"
0,"When it worked, it worked well, but...","When my old Zyliss gave up the ghost I looked about for a replacement. I have other OXO products and am pleased with them, so I gave this a flyer. On the plus side, it's sturdy and very easy to operate. However, I found that most of the time, about four cans out of five, it wouldn't cut the lid completely off. I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one."
0,Sesame Street - Happy Healthy Monsters,I am VERY disappointed with this video. I bought it for my 2 year old thinking it would be a great way to exercise her entire body and use large motor skills.

But some people including Bunny Stirrup don't want this new family survive and they would anything to stop it.This book looks like it would be fun. But Ms. Brown does bring any real emotions behind the characters. Many of the characters seem so fake would not act the why that did real life. It was an okay but seem to lack something."
0,A WORKOUT OR A COMMERCIAL?,"If I could have given less than one star on this purchase I would have done so. What a huge disappointment. The dance combinations when performed together lasts for exactly 42.2 SECONDS! And these are not difficult combinations. Her segment advertising her other videos: 3:37, her bio segment 1:03 and her performance segment 4:09. Her performance segment in not even a bhangra dance. It is an average performance of classical Indian dance, more notable for it's interesting camera angles and special effects.I teach dance for exercise and was hoping to learn some bhangra to lend some authenticity to my Bollywood routines. These combination would not even be sufficient to fill the chorus in the music.I will definitely be returning this."
0,Wait for the sequel or the movie.,"A fun, light read. No surprises; done before and better. Visual and effects oriented more than plot driven. Liked the strange fog. Read like a screenplay adaptation and would work better on the SciFi channel or in theaters as a 90 minute action flick. Will not stretch your mind or explain the mysteries of the world to your satisfaction."
1,Surprisingly Good,"As others have noted, this is probably the best Dead Can Dance tribute album made so far. True, many of the covers do not deviate from the original delivery. The sound quality in these is very good, however, which was something that many fans found lacking in DCD's first album. How great it is to hear ""In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated"" sung clearly and crisply!"

0,Not a Great Product,"I can't compare these pacifiers to others because they're the only kind we've given to our newborn daughter. She takes them and doesn't seem to have a problem with them. I have a few complaints though- they accumulate gunk where the pacifier attaches, water gets inside the pacifier part when we boil them, and they leave marks on my daughter's cheeks. And because they're so tight against her cheeks, her cheeks are red and moist after she spits it out. I'm going to switch to a different product before they give her a rash. Definitely do not get these pacifiers."

This book is a must read, you will not be disappointed!"
1,A tale of the population explosion nightmare,"Widely unread, I've only ever met one person who has heard of it, it was made into a film in the seventies - Soylent Green.Make Room, Make Room tells of a future on the brink, over-populated and under-fed, where only the vey rich get food as we know it, and the rest get processed garbage, called Soylent, the most prized item of which is Soylent Steaks. Ruthless police enforce draconian laws on a desperate population whose daily struggle for food and shelter takes up their whole lives.There is a central plot for the main character to follow, but quite frankly, I've forgotten it, so long is it since I read this book.The reader discovers the truth about the source of the misleadingly named Soylent in the book's closing chapters, and may be amused to find The Netherlands portrayed as the Promised Land.Richard Barlowrichardb@groupcsa.co"

0,Very misleading title - don't waste your money,"It is not possible to be a home-based travel agent. As explained in the book, the agencies through whom you have to work to make bookings and get your commissions for airlines require that you have an address that is in a commercial building zoned as such. The book gives you an out by suggesting you work for a travel agent or get one to give you a contract to be an extension of that agency. As a result you have to pay them a setup (or franchise fee) and then you have to split your commissions with them. This is not what I call a home-based travel agency business."

1,Compact travelling alarm clcoks,"My wife and I have been using Westclox travelling alarms for years. They are reliable and well designed. Unfortunately, the new version available in the UK has a touch screen which is complicated and difficult to use in the dark when you are half asleep, and so we had to buy this legacy version from US Amazon (incurring additional postage). The only small cavil is that the sliding control buttons are now bevelled and not as easy to manipulate as the ones on previous models that were available in the UK."

However since i was a first time player to the game, i thought due to other reviews of this game that this would be the game i needed to teach myself how to play. How wrong i was. It's not that this is a BAD game, i guess my complaint is more along the lines of the user interface. I'm pretty well rounded with computers and software, and even i was confused as to how to change games, change boards, difficulty, ect ect.I passed the game along to a few other people, and not to my surprise, they returned the game back to me after about a day reporting the same frustrations that i was having.All in all, i learned to play the old fashioned way, on a real board."
1,Liberating effect of Russian Revolution,"This is the book to find out about the impact of the Russian Revolution in the U.S., before Stalinism. Cannon was the most important of the original American communist leaders-and a great writer to boot. In his easy and colorful style, he focuses on the critical importance of the Russian Revolution for his generation of working class militants. Those who rallied to its banner gave a vital impetus to all later fighters for social change. Among the most valuable lessons are how the communists defended all class-war prisoners, regardless of their adherence to communism, including the story about Big Bill Haywood and the International Labor Defense. Also interesting, is Cannon's appendix on the ""Negro Question"" (as it was then known). I'm convinced by his thesis-that the Russian Revolution and the existence of a U.S. communist party had a liberating effect on the Black struggle in the 1920s."
1,Excellent Blend of Christianity with the Paranormal!!!,"Loved the book! Read it in one sitting. Looking for more from this author in this genre. Enjoyed the blending of the christianity with the paranormal and the deep South! ""And don't call me Shirley!"""
0,Feedback,The VHS I purchased doesn't work. When I put it in it's black and white and is scrambled. Products should be tested before they are sold.
1,One of the few books Ive read over and over.,"I bought this book years ago, and have ended up reading it year after year. In England it was published under a different title:- Unnatural Selection, I recommend it utterly if you want to smile throughout a book. Thank God we have few roaches in this country!"

1,Everything you could ever want,"If you like the Jackson 5 then this album is for you. There are 36 songs on this dual-disc album. It has every single song you can imagine. Personally I am not a huge Jackson 5 fan, but I love MIchael Jackson, and I feel like this album does a great job with the mass amount of songs that the Jackson 5 released. The only problem I have with this album is like most music, is that after a while all of the songs start to sound the same and you really don't realize when a song starts or when it ends, just because it all starts to mesh together, but it is a solid collection of music. I definitely would recommend it to people that enjoy the J5"
0,Did a Writing 101 student write this book?,"This book is really, really not good. Topping my list of complaints is how thinly the characters are written. One character is not distinguishable from the next. The plot is not well developed and unbelievable. My biggest complaint (and this goes back to the characters) is what a miserable heroine Isabelle is. She radiates dullness and doesn't really do anything. This book really does appear to be the effort of a writing student, and I couldn't help but think, ""How was this book ever published?"" I gave this 2 stars only because it was published, so maybe there's some greatness here that I don't see, and also because Ms. Bloom does appear to catch up a little towards the end of the novel.Bottom line, you will be disappointed."
1,Great place to begin,I give this to students as a place to begin or review basic English vocabulary. Working on their language skills a rate of 10 minutes a day they feel like it's easy to learn.

I DESTROYED IT."
0,its all about what you like,"If you are a little kim lover, then this is for you. Just like her original album, she displays a raw attitude about men, money, clothes and sex. This CD gives us a look into Kim's life, and displays some things we rather not know. Some of the beats are fresh and new, and there are some things borrowed also (samples). This CD is definately ""out there"" and will definately shock."
0,"Sorry, but this movie let me down","""The Patriot"" is Mel Gibson's attempt to return to his ""Braveheart"" glory, and unfortunately he fails. This movie really caught my interest for the first twenty minutes, and then really started to drag on. By the time it was to a scene where Gibson was hiding his family out in a some coastal town, I was considering getting up and doing something else. The acting is good and so is the scenery, but British atrocities are grossly exaggerated, and there is little emphasis on the actual war. The whole movie's basically a revenge plot, the villain's so evil that it's hard to believe that there was a British leader like that, and did I mention that the movie's almost two hours too long? Plot and emotion are good, but ""The Patriot"" way overdoes it. I finally resumed interest in the final battle scene, which is impressive. If only the whole movie had been as good as the beginning and the end. If you want a Gibson war movie, watch ""Braveheart"". 2 1/2 Stars"

1,Pretty good book for people who really want to learn theory,In my course of Fluid Mechanics at the University of Brasília (UnB) I've been studying this subject through McDonald and Fox's Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and I really think that Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics is the best choice for people who really want to learn the theory . Besides that Mcdonald and Fox's is better in terms of exercises
1,Great for beginning readers,"My grandson is a beginning reader. He loved Diary of a Worm. He read it with some difficulty at first and then reread it about 5 times,with much laughter each time. After the 2nd time he could read it easily. This is the kind of book which makes a child want to read."
0,Degree of Difficulty,"I had the Word 2003 program before getting 2007, and I find the new product to be a LOT harder to use and way too busy. The Home and Student edition should be for those of us who are not working in offices or are computer experts. It's taking me far too long to figure this thing out after being used to the much simpler version I had before.Carrol L. Fry"
0,What a self-serving LOSER book!,"Basically, this is a puff piece, a literary kiss on the rump, to anyone who PAYS Curt Scott for space in his book.

0,NOT For Shabbat Use,"I own and love a smaller manual Hamilton Beach crockpot that I use to keep meatballs warm for the kids on Shabbat. When I decided I needed a second crockpot for soup or cholent for the adults, I decided to go for the fancier model.Disaster struck.On Shabbat morning, I found the crockpot completely off and my cholent rapidly cooling. I blamed myself; I must have done something wrong. But no, it wasn't me. THIS SUCKER SHUTS ITSELF OFF AFTER 14 HOURS. Unfortunately, that's in the small print, buried on page whatever-you-never-actually-get-to in the manual. In other words, this crockpot is completely and utterly unusable for Shabbat.Back it goes."
1,greatbook,"i really enjoyed this story. after having rea both into thin ai and into th wild i have really gained an appreciation for krakauers writing. i was really interested in chris mccandless, although i found his obsession with the transcendental beliefs a little out there. this could have been my favorite book if my high shcool english teaher (v. lojko) hadnt ruined it wih stupid assignments. for all teachers out there, dont treat this book like a classic work of fiction. dont make kids compare it to guys like thoreau or emerson. the only way to enjoy it is to read for your own enjoyment"
1,Best machine and BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,"WOW. I bought this machine over 3 years ago, have loved it every minute of every day (fast brew time, proper 200 degree brewing temperature, great coffee) and yesterday afternoon it stopped working. The heating unit apparently gave out. Called Bunn customer service, they asked for a date code from the bottom, then told me they'd be shipping me a new one and gave me an order number. THE EASIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!! (And let me just say that, technically, I was about two months outside of the 3 year warranty -- but they clearly use manufacturing dates and build in some wiggle room, probably to keep customers happy -- a technique that companies like Sony, Apple, Panasonic, etc. would do well to adopt -- because Bunn just bought my brand loyalty for a VERY long time!) Can't say enough good things about the machine or the company. Job well done!"
1,Another reason it is grand to work for Starbucks!,"Luke Temple's music caught my ear while I was making caramel frappuccinos for a gang of My Chemical Romance sheep. The song was ""Someone, Somewhere,"" and I was immediately captivated. Ironically, these fashioncore preteens called the music unbearable, which further validated my interest in Temple's sound. His is a fresh sound very much influenced by Simon and Drake, but I also feel he's on the same musical wavelength as the brilliant Sondre Lerche, albeit a more stripped down one. Luke Temple is true talent and this disc should not be ignored."
0,the MOVIE was better than this!!,"seriously, if you want to hear about this story so much, go see the movie. this book was the most revolting, disgusting, boring, cliche'd book ive ever read. it was much too religious for anyone to stand too. i cannot understand at all why there are so many five star reviews and how this guy is a ny times bestseller author. its just insanely BAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!"
0,CDs are a mixed bag but DVD is just horrible,"What can I say, this is one strange package. The DVD has a short biography of Tchaikovsky which is okay but it then reverts to a biographical ballet which places an overwhelming amount of emphasis on the composers sexuality. Tchaikovsky was a great composer. Who cares about his sexuality more than 100 years later? Give me a break. The two CDs have one exceptional performance, Vladimir Spivakov playing the violin concerto. His tone is huge, his phrasing breathtaking and the performance has real fire. The short pieces are also done quite well. The ballet excerpts have really poor sound and dull performances. Finally, there is Derek Han playing the 1st Piano Concerto. It is okay but this is not Mr. Han's speciality. He is a world famous Mozartian and deservedly so. Here his playing is labored and not very passionate. Unless you think is a real bargain, I would avoid this DVD/CD combination."
1,Loved by the kids,"I bought this movie for my nephew and niece. They absolutely love it. They watched it over and over again. My sister and I used to watch it when we were younger, so it is nice to see the next generation enjoy it as well."
0,Dosent even deserve 1 star,"Without a doubt one of the most pathetic films ever made. Extreamly bad acting, Stupid camera angles, Most of the time you cant tell what is happening. The transforming from animals to humans vice vera is the worst effect ever, Basicly you see a bird flying and in the next shot (About a second after) the hairy chuck norris is standing there. Punches look so fake its amazing, Incredibly bad directing makes it look like a 9 year old could of done better if he went into the woods with a cam-corder and some pals. The budget is obvisly tighter than an italien waiters trousers and the only reason chuck norris is in the movie is beocouse the film was made by his brother aron nossis! I really really, really really recomend not buying this film."

0,These bottles suck!!,"I bought these bottles for my new granddaughter and have had nothing but problems with the bottom leaking!! She has a problem with gas and I thought these would be an improvement over the traditional bottle--no way!! She sucked so hard on the nipples, she got a blister on her upper lip. We discovered that part of the problem was the bottom ring was too tight, and loosing it slightly helped the baby have to suck less hard. They worked fine when brand new, but after several uses...I have had several lapfuls of formula and she has gotten regular formula baths. We are going to a different bottle now. I do not recommend them other than the fact they are easier to clean."
0,Mom in NC,"We replaced a used Fisher Price monitor that had been given to us that had a couple of quirks, probably from use. We bought the Crisp and Clear and found it to be Tempermental and Hissy. Just turning it on produces hissy, high volume static, nearly every time. Some nights it would awaken us, not with the sounds of our sleeping baby, but with a low hum or a repetitive chirping noise. I guess we'll continue our search elsewhere."

0,Great Series - Worst Season,"This was an incredibly maddening season - it just seemed to go from one preposterous weakness to another. It STARTED with a nuclear explosion on American soil. Where do you go from there? By the middle of the season (12 hours into the story) everyone seems to have forgotten that we had just suffered a nuclear holocaust! The former president is stabbed by his nutty ex-wife and then...nothing! He, his ex and former Secret Service agent Aaron just disappear. This happens to characters throughout the season. All this may be explained by the fact that the writers publicly admitted that they had no bible - no pre-planned story arc. They were making it up as they went along! This is NOT storytelling; it is the video equivalent of a child attempting to convey a story and continually saying ""and then..and then...and then."" This series gets one more chance with me. If it doesn't show me something next season, that's it."

1,My baby loves it,"The meowing sound is cute, I don't find it annoying like some toys. My baby also get excited when it starts to vibrate and tries to pick it up. It is a little heavy but hey babies need a challenge. The feet are soft and my baby seems to enjoy chewing on it's ears."
1,a good entry level camcorder,"My first cam, for home video only.pic and sound are good, with adapter you can play tape on any VCRs. pretty light in my view, i can easily operate with one hand, battery life is 1.5 hour, compatible batteries can provide better number.only has black & white viewfinder, no LCD, but for this low price, i can live with it.overall, good cam for first time or entry level user who just want to record some family moments and share it, for that purpose this is a good choice."

1,GREAT FILM!,"A dramatic adventure about a young Amish boy who becomes a witness to a murder. Harrison Ford earned an Oscar nomination for his performance as John Book, a Philadelphia a cop who is forced to flee the city and live with the Amish in order to protect the young witness and his mother, played by Kelly McGillis. The story provides a wonderful contrast between the rough, violent world of the city and the serene, pacifist attitudes of Old-Order Amish. Enchanting music, outstanding cinematography of Pennsylvania Amish Country, and fine perfomances."
0,In a word dissapointed,Please belive me I love Stephen King and have read all his books (does every review start off like this?) But this one left me wanting a lot more. I think he could have done a lot more character development. Not only with Trisha but Pete and her parents needed more content. I guess I am spoiled. But I really think Mr King is resting on his laurels on this one (reminds me of Cujo).
0,"Very thin, rips easily","This will not hold up with a 3 to 4 year old. Bought this for my son, and it has ripped in so many places! It did rip a little when I put it on and zipped it, but I just assumed it was going to be a problem at the seam. It's not. It ripped right down the middle where I needed it to hold up.

0,Good overview but not enough detail,"SiteServer 3.0 deserves a thorough write-up. This book ain't it. While Harris does give a good tour of the product, he doesn't go into nearly enough detail. The search section, for example, is a measly 30 pages, and most of those are filled with unnecessary screen shots. I really don't need to see what the web page he's talking about looks like...I can go see it for myself. All that page space would have been better filled with descriptions of what you can do with search and how to do it.I think the problem is that SiteServer 3.0 is too big to cover in a single volume. A 3-volume set -- Overview/Install; Knowledge; and Commerce -- would be better. Still waiting for that."
1,It's Triple the Reading Pleasure,"I read this book when it first came out some time back. It's one of the few books that I can't seem to be able to keep out of my mind.

0,"A Superficial ""Puff Piece""","""Blue Streak"" goes on and on about customer service and happy employees, as though the two are directly linked and create a profitable entity. Forgotten (or neglected) is how much jetBlue's success depends on aircraft utilization (eg. fast aircraft turnaround - copied from Southwest; long hours/day), low fuel costs (eg. Southwest's hedging program), low costs overall (Southwest and AirTrans both beat jetBlue), ability to bypass intense competition (eg. early Wal-Mart and Southwest locations), and ability to fill planes at maximum revenues (eg. using intelligent price discrimination).Recently jetBlue's financial results went into the loss column, and the stock was downgraded. Other airlines are lowering their costs (eg. using bankruptcy court to force union givebacks and shed pensions) and prices, and parking many of their old fuel-guzzlers. Thus, competition is intensifying and it will take much more than employee smiles for jetBlue to succeed."

1,It worked!,"I went off the pill because we wanted to conceive. The first month, I had tons of cervical mucus. Then--no CM for the best part of a year! I had some other health issues that derailed the baby-making, but when we were ready to get back, I bought fertile CM. I took it from around CD 4 along with Mucinex and Evening Primrose Oil (the latter is supposed to help with making high quality CM). That month I had gobs of CM! And, guess what? I got pregnant! So I would say that this works...now, I was also taking EP oil, stopped drinking alcohol and coffee and was juicing, so those things might have helped too. However, it was only with the Fertile CM that I actually got CM."
1,The Queen of the Big Time,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters and their life stories were fascinating and very well written. For my taste the two of Trigiani's books that I've read end with a bit too much sentimentality, but of course some people may like that."
0,BrokenBday,"First, I was upset because I did not get an e-mail letting me know my package was delivered. Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up."
1,"Pretty good, but Shaara needs to learn how to use pronouns","The Last Full measure is the story of the end of the civil war (post-Gettysburg). The book mainly focuses on Lee, Grant, and Joshua Chamberlin. The book definetly gets you into the civil war, but not as much as The Killer Angels. The Last Full Measure is definetly not as good as the Killer Angels, but then again, the Killer Angels won the pulitzer prize.My main criticism of the book is Jeff Shaara's style of writing. It drives me crazy. He doesn't know how to use pronouns. Here is a good example: ""He looked around, saw his horse, held by a groom, began to move that way, stopped, said to Porter..."". Eventually, I got used to the way he wrote.I'd reccommend buying this book. It's a good read and it seems to be, from my knowledge of the civil war, to be very accurate."

1,Near Perfect Progressive Rock Cd,"I had burned the second cd a few weeks before the cd was realesed in stores. I thought the second cd was actually a 42 min song with 8 parts. So I burned the eight parts separtly. At first I was dissipointed. It sounded way to happy and the songs were mostly singing with little rocking improv's. Well After I heard the first cd I totally changed my mind. This Is an Incredible cd, here is a rating of each song, with a 1-5 star rating.1st cd- ""The Glass Prison""-5 stars- More Gutiar Work,""Blind Faith""-5 Stars,""Misunderstood""-5 Stars,""The Great Debate""-""4 1/2 stars"",""Dissapear""- 4 stars, 2nd cd- ""Overture""- 4 stars, ""About To Crash""- 5 stars, ""War Inside my Head""- 3 1/2 stars, ""The Test That Stumped Them All""- 3 Stars, ""GoodNight Kiss""- 4 1/2 stars, ""Solitary Shell""- 5 stars, ""About To Crash Reprise""- 5 Stars, Grand Finale- 4 stars"
1,Timer,"I had bought another timer that cost much more but this one is perfect. It's so easy to use. I do several exercises for 60 seconds each and this timer makes it so easy to keep repeating the time. I set it for 60 seconds and when the alarm sounds, I just hit the button once and it starts over."
1,From an Older Time,"I ordered this movie for my father, who remembers it from his younger days. It's a lovely story, but it is also very dated. It would be a great choice for a classic movie buff, but younger generations may not appreciate it."

0,Vanity & Worse,"A wandering, boorish, freshman attempt at literature. A bright shining epic mess at best. The author openly borrows from the classics in a fumbling inept attempt at originality. A heroic bloggers ongoing vain self absorbed diatribe woefully boring. Wonderful companion for trans Atlantic flights when one has forgotten sleeping pills or the bathroom is lacking toilet paper. The author would do everyone a favor if he worked through a few remedial writing courses and honed his craft before butchering the written word with self centered pomposity. An ""A"" for an eighth grade effort. Perhaps with focus, originality and sweat we will see something worth reading emerge. A Roman orgy of self absorbtion,vanity and open embarassment. The work ethic of Shelby Foote would be a very good measure and prime example of great prose and literary craftsmanship."
0,"Hard to follow, disjointed and uninformative","I am a very open minded person and their *may* be truth behind quantum mechanics but this film fails to adequately go into any detail or true explanation of it. Instead we have a smorgasboard of random statements thrown together interspersed with video that looks and feels like it's half documentary, half early nineties high school instructional video. This doesn't seem like a professionally made movie but rather a half-hearted tv movie. Even if you are open minded and interested in quantum mechanics I doubt this will be your cup of tea."
1,This is definitely a classic!,"After seeing the movie as a ""special"" on television, I knew I had to get the movie. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are absolutely charming together on screen!!!

0,I'm with the previous reviewer,"Okay, it's got great visuals; in fact, they should have had MORE HELICOPTERS and just called this Dragons Versus Helicopters, and done without the plot altogether. Because the plot is...sad to stay...stupid. And when I use that word, I don't mean just a little bit stupid, but way, way stupid. Gosh, it sure was lucky for humanity that there was only the ONE male dragon, and that the females were sort of hive support for it. Just...why did it take through the downfall of the entirely of world civilization to find this out? And why was he so easy to kill once we'd found him? And on and on.So okay, if you're going to spend that much money on the special effects, why not blow a few more bucks on the scriptwriters and not second guess them? This is a movie to watch, for sure, but...with the sound OFF."
0,Don't even bother!!,"...The dialogue was so artificial and the acting was so poor. It seems that some one tried to mix ""Executive Decision"", that the bit when Dolph tapped the submarine steel hull to send morse codes, Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" martial arts display and special ops background + calling off the attack of fighter jets shooting air to air missiles which miraculously changed into anti-submarine torpedoes but keep on missing the target. I never thought a Harpoon anti-ship missile could be used to shoot down a Mach-1 or more fighter jet. As for ""Agent Red"", well better spend you money on books on genetic engineering or microbiology. As for the containment room, a high school positive pressure cabinet has more chance of containing the virus, which were kept in glass vials so thin that they broke so easily."

0,Buyer be aware! Potential fraud...,"I ordered 90010, and recieved a package with labels 90010. However, after I opened the package and tried the item, I realized the item that is packaged in the 90010 packaging is actually an 90040! It has only counter functionality, without any timer feature that 90010 has. And of course, 90040 is cheaper. I myself consider this action fraud.On top of that, returning the wrong is NOT easy because it was fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. You cannot do it on the web, and you have to call them. And you cannot do exchange... You have to ship it back and re-buy... All of these because the order is fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. A vendor that smells like fraud to me - yes, they packaged 90040 into a 90010 original packaging. Very suspecious. Too much hassle to go through.... I don't suggest you buy this item rom Amazon.com. Go to your local store and buy it."
0,A big let down,"I was hoping this book would be as humors and enjoyable as Sex and the City. Instead I got four stories about characters that were so one dimentional as the book I was reading. Each story ending leaving me feeling I was stopped in the middle of an intersection. Their was no closeure on anyone of the characters. This book is being sold mainly on the authors reputation and is not worth the money. Stick to watching ""Sex and the City"" on HBO. It is much more enjoyable than wasting your time on a book where the characters have no personality or life of their own. This books leaves you feeling let down and suckered into buying a book where the anticipation ends on page one."
1,Incredible music...,"If you love guitar, not just only jazz guitar, you have to listen to this record, definitely on the best guitar CD of 2002 ( well, one of the best guitar album of the last 10 years should I even say ). Sylvain plays with such finesse and technical expertise throughout the whole album, yet keeping it easy to listen to. His acoustic tone is gorgeous, and Jafet and Ceccarelli just are perfect as always on bass and drums respectively. Try and be convinced..."
0,A biased policy paper,As a parent of an exceptionally gifted child I found many of the resources listed in this book to be helpful but thought that the text was very biased and confrontational.
1,Good Trimmer,This trimmer does a very nice job. I've used it in wet and dry environments without issue. I've even rinsed it under running water while it is on without any problems. So it fits the bill in wet/dry. I am very happy with the ease of attachment and removal of the trim guard. Also the height adjustment of the trim guard and on/off is very easy in both wet and dry environments.
1,A Must Read For Parents,"""Is He A Man Or Just Another Guy?"" should be part of every family's parenting ""toolbox."" Do you have a daughter(s)? This book will help to raise their level of expectations in a relationship. Do you have a son(s)? This book provides a map to move a boy from guyhood to manhood. I do not know of another book in the marketplace that so thoroughly and completely explores the subject of mate selection. Although my daughters are still quite young, they will have a copy of this book waiting for them when it's time to start looking for Mr. Right."
0,Couldn't get past chapter 3,"I deleted this from my kindle after chapter 3! The description sounds great but it's really a religious proselitizing book. i hate to be hit over the head about jesus, christianity, and so forth. And, when the character is either thinking or talking about church, religion, god and so forth it's in italics. As if I can't get it or something! I found it pedantic, obvious and dull. I don't mind religious references or characters, but this one is way over the top!"
1,Touching and Romantic...a Great Book!,"I honestly just picked this book up b/c i kept seeing it places and figured i would try it. It was a really great book and i have recommended it to almost everyone. Not only is the storyline entertaining, touching, and romantic (without being too girly and sappy)...but the author does an amazing job of building the characters. I was disappointed when the book was done because i wanted to keep reading."
1,YOU CANT HAVE FRIDAY AND NOT THIS,"3 1/2 STARSThis movie is enjoyable and funny.If you are a fan of Ice Cube click order now.Althogh it is not as good as FRIDAY it does have its funny parts and you cant own FRIDAY with out Next Friday.But some people said they liked Next Friday better and i cant argue with that.Day Day was funny, i liked how he talks when he is upset he just mumbles, although he isnt as hilarious as Smokey(Chris Tucker-FRIDAY)but he does make you laugh.Gee i hope they make another sequel with Smokey & Day Day.But just let me sum it all up for you.If you havent got FRIDAY you shouldnt be reading this right now as you must have to the original before buying this.If you already own FRIDAY by all means click order now as you wont be dissapointed.RECOMENDED"
1,Most Comfortable Asics Volleyball Shoe!,Most comfortable Asics volleyball shoe according to the D1 volleyball players who use it here. It really is too bad that it has been discontinued.
0,Bostitch c6r8=99bcg,These nails have too thick of a connecting wire that jams my hitachi nail gun. I would not recommend this product. Other coil nails use a thinner connecting wire so they work just fine. I install fence boards and these just dont do the trick.
0,Squish the mouse!,"I don't know what to say. I bought this album and after hearing it over and over, i cant find any other favorite song other than ""Float On"". Yes, the song before it is fine, and the final two songs are fine. But it is a deception in the sense that its just too weird. Some songs are just too wacky. The horns, trumpets get too wild and a combination of bad music plus the lead singer's voice is a complete catastrophy. All I know is that I wasted my money on this. I expected more catchy songs other than ""Float On"", but there are hardly any other than that one. They have some soft songs too, perhaps too soft. I would not recommend this album. Do NOT waste your money. Instead, download ""Float On"" and that's it."
1,Hours of fun washing his 'dirty' trains,This little engine wash quickly became my son's favorite Thomas destination. All of a sudden all his trains are 'dirty' and he'll spend hours driving each of them around the track and through the engine wash.
0,Don't buy!,I purchased two pair of these braces and they are not worth the money. The material is cheap and the brace is poorly constructed. My attempts to contact the company were unsucessful. We're switching back to the McDavid braces which are Podiatrist recommended.
1,A Return to Form for Jacques,"After generally lacking creativity in most of his books, I had to begun to think that Jacques was losing it, and failing to create any original ideas.This book was a return to form for Jacques. While the principles remain the same: morally good or not good characters whom you could clearly relate to or against (this is a good thing), the concretes changed. This time, the setting is much more unique, the characters are a bit more original, the villains are very, very different from Jacques' previous outings, and the story of family betrayal is intriguing.Definitely one of Jacques' best, and definitely the best of his later books."
0,Far from being perfect,"Amazon was very fast, efficient and reliable.The product is a cool product, it's light, small, easy to connect disconnect to your key ring, but, it's a big one, from my understanding it's suppose to have 3 different positions, one full and strong light, the other is a weaker light and the third, a blinking light. We bought 2 pieces for me and my girlfriend, both worked strange in the begining, had only one position of pressing then having the light, when leaving the finger off, the light gets off. Mine now work fine with the 3 positions, my girlfriend one stayed the same as was, which is broken I guess."
0,Zojirushi Coffee Maker,"I purchased this coffee maker about 3 weeks ago - I am sending it back today. There have been problems with water leaking from whoknowswhere, the filters are too big, entire unit is flimsy and cheap and today there was coffee all over the floor and kitchen counter.... the carafe is difficult to open and close, the little top plastic lid is annoying and I keep inadvertently changing the clock. The only positive thing I can say about this coffee maker is that it is fairly quiet when brewing but on the whole it is a mess."
0,Doesn't last long,"I'm sad to say that this bike doesn't last too long. I got it for my first son, he played it a few times (not too much, maybe 20 times in all). We just brought it out for the second kiddo to try and he played it twice and it stopped working all together. The screen garbled and it turned off three times in a row and then it wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought it was the batteries at first, but then I changed them with brand new ones and it still wouldn't turn on. I googled and found that the circuit board has issues and many were returned. Wish I'd known that sooner! I do not recommend this toy, it's quality isn't all that great anyway (but my boys loved it), and then it breaks and makes them sad they can't use it."
0,Can't believe I spent money on this,"This pad of paper looks like something that was photocopied back in the 90s. It has no cover and is just a pad of paper. You could easily find an image of this online, print it out at home, and it would be the exact same thing as this product. The paper however is a great guide for learning calligraphy."

0,Disappointing and odd typesetting,"The book was highly recommended to my twelve year old daughter. Because Annie dislike fantasy and science fiction, I purchased the trilogy based on a brief overview. Annie likes adventure, problem solving, and ""chick flicks"" She adored Legally Blonde and I hoped that <The train to Estelline would be a story about a career girl. What we had instead, was a series of thefts, double dealing, prostitution, murder, child abuse, and manipulative people. I don't need a book for this. Our newspapers and country lyrics are filled with the disappointment, heartache, and lowlife depicted in the book. It is a page turner, but for the wrong reason. I read the book to see how the author would write her way back to anything resembling good story telling. It was also very odd the way the typesetter consistently wrote al1 with the numeral one at the end. I classify the book as a less well written Cold Mountain."
1,A Concise History of the US's Most Important Year,"Mr. McCullough has once again succeeded in writing a readable history book about the early years of the US.I struggle with Non-Fiction books. They take much longer for me to read than fiction and they can at times be laborious.I am happy to report however that this is not the case with 1776.The book helped me to appreciate the greatness of General Washington, and also to understand the sacrifice of all those soldiers that fought for the independence of the US.Great book. I'm now following up with His Excellency by Joseph Ellis."
1,2002 - Amazing!!!,"The music of 2002 is truly amazing. If you are already a fan, Deep Still Blue will be the perfect addition to their previous albums. If you are unfamiliar with their music why not start here. You not only get a wonderful CD, but you get a bonus DVD with the most spectacular underwater photography providing a visual backdrop to the music as well as some very interesting extras.Pamela and Randy Copus are truly gifted musicians and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next!"
1,Wishing it came in hardcover.,"I'm a little disappointed because I'm looking into buying a few of the books about the series. Of the four I'd like to get, one of them is only in hardcover (Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale) and one is only in paperback (this one).I'm not trying to complain, but it would be amazing if this came as a hardcover considering every other book published is available in that form. Either way, I just wish I could have them all in the same format to make them look somewhat uniform on my shelf."
1,Not his best album but ...,"Four stars is not bad for an album tht is not nearly as good as some of his earlier work. ""Booty and the Beast"" and ""One Million Broken Guitars' are both 5 star efforts. Popa is one of the best blues guitarists out there, and I've seen most of them. Deserves more recognition. Maybe it's his crazy psydonym that holds him back."
1,Great product!,"Great product, the best trackballs out there. I had a customer support issue that was resolved after I escalated it a bit. If you have any problem with customer support, make sure you contact the US office, as their off-site support can be spotty. They need to improve the drivers for Windows 7, but I understand it is in process."
1,Age old story retold,"A very old story retold about the damage rumours can cause. 5 stars for the illustration! Beautiful artwork by Loren Long. I get the feeling Madonna was trying to push this book out too quickly. Her storytelling just seems to be lacking a little in this one. Don't get me wrong - it is a great story with good values to be learned. I really am happy to see that all the proceeds from Madonna's children's books go to a good cause, ""the Spirituality for Kids Foundation"". Something the world is lacking these days. So Keep it up Madonna!"
0,Dont Buy!!,"Sizing is completeley incorrect, I bought 1 size larger than usual and not even...!!! the problem is the size of junction between the Thumb and the index finger that is too small.Leather quality not at all as advertised.Not a driving glove, to stiff for it!!I dont recomend buying this!!"
0,Don't be fooled,"Do not buy this product. The description implies that the clipper attachment is metal and is somehow ""professional"" in quality, but in fact, it is mostly made of cheap plastic with a cheap aluminum clip. The teeth are sharp and not rounded and the overall quality is lower than the standard plastic attachments. I would send it back if the shipping didn't cost more than the product."
1,"Bamboo, wow",Was all that I could imagine except the metal spring is a little less springier that the old ones I replaced. Solved that problem by using the old springs on the new bamboo clips. Works better than ever now/
1,This book will enlighten and humble you.,"With his book ""The Whole Shebang"", Timothy Ferris opens ones eyes to the beauty and complexity of the universe we live in. This book will send shivers down your spine when you listen to what he says about the origins of the universe and life. This book addresses the big important questions that everyone should think about. It will give you a better understanding of the nature of the universe and your position in it. ""The Whole Shebang"" is an extremely interesting, fascinating book that was written for everyone to enjoy, not just astrophysicists."
0,Slow Going,"I think this movie has potential to the right person. For me, the entire movie was slow. I just could not get into it."
0,Some good content,"This book has some good content, but in its attempt to present methods for people to use, it ignores the fact that the Bible has shown models and methods that make a ton more sense then reiterating over and over terminology that has been created for the point the authors are making. Read the book, but look at what the Bible says. Hopefully you have studied the Bible first."
1,"Terrific home workout, only lacks a few muscles","This is easily the best strength training video I've ever used, and after several years I am still not bored with it! I love being able to choose one arm, one ab, and one buns workout for a full-body tone-up. My only complaint is that it's not quite full-body as there are no moves for the chest and only one workout has one back exercise. But nothing is stopping me from doing a few push-ups on my own and I am so grateful to have this DVD in my collection."
1,Good and value to the price,I ordered this product from amazon and really satisfied with it. It arrived in time.
1,A Flag Worth Flying,"This is just the flag we wanted fling from our home. It's colorful, easy to manage and most important it reflex the focus of our life."
1,how i like his music,Nick Curran is very talented for his age.He has got a very excellent voice.I would rate him 5 stars.I hope that he keeps playing for years to come.
0,Achitectual Graphic Standards,The reprsentation was not clear this is a reproduction of a 1935 published book. This is not usefull in todays building enviroment.
1,Wings of Refuge,"I have enjoyed reading other books by Lynn Austin, Christian books with a Jewish background. This book especially in story form I purchased because she presented a good way to show Jesus was the Son of God to the Jews who love God and accept that Jesus lived but don't recognize Him for who He really is. I hope some time her thoughts can help me share with someone."
0,Buy it at the drug store,"This is the same food grade mineral oil they sell at any drug store to use as a laxative or personal lubricant (no explanation needed on those two lol). I can get almost half a gallon of the stuff at CVS for the same price. It's odorless, colorless, tasteless and crystal clear (no dyes) just like this stuff. I use plain old food grade mineral oil for my cutting bored, on my cutting shears for the garden, diamond honing stone ect ect... I use this stuff on any thing you would not want to use a petroleum based oil or to use it when it would come in contact with food (I.E. food grade mineral oil is ~food safe~).And no... you have to actually consume in the amounts descried on the bottle to get the laxative effect (like a table spoon or two worth, that`s not an accidental amount and all it will do is ""loosen"" you up not poison you)."
1,"Great, but needs new edition.","I've used this book as an ESL teacher and thought it was excellent. It definitely covered advanced and tricky structures with abundant exercises: both oral and written. The examples need updating, however. I'm waiting for the next edition."
1,Blast from the past,This 80s compilation features some fantastic tracks by one hit wonder TILL TUESDAY-voices carry and its got EUROPEs second big hit CARRIE plus all time favorites by NENA and BAD ENGLISH at their best with when i see you smile but the track which made me buy this compilation is Hearts on Fire - Randy Meisner
1,Excellent Book for Beginners,"I ordered this book for a jacket pattern and was pleasantly surprised at the rest of the content of the book. As a beginning knitter, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the language of knitting. Sally Melville's book is a great resource to me every day that I knit. The illustrations and instructions are clear and the patterns have lots of diagrams to help. One of the best features (besides the basic instructions - which I need) is the layout of each pattern - she details the skill level, the fit, scale, yarn details and equipment in a quick reference format that has proved extremely clear and easy to use. I've used other beginning knitter books and this one is by far my favorite. I will eventually give away my other beginning-to-knit books, but this one I will keep."
0,A horrible waste of both time and money.,"If only the packaging for this video were a bit softer, I just may have a use for it. I cannot recall ever in my life turning off a movie after only having viewed 30 minutes of it. A terrible remake of an exquisite classic, this film does not deserve to wear the name it bears on the front cover."
1,Good book. Very informative,"This book was wonderful. The vast history in the book was very interesting. I couldn't put it down I had to finish it in one weekend. From reading reviews before I bought the book I thought It would be alot of gross out stuff, but it wasn't. This author really took the time to know what he was talking about. His research was thorough and he also gave credit to anyone who deserved it. This isn't just a book bashing the unhealthfulness of Fast Food, but rather a commentary on what the Fast Food industry is doing to economies and waistlines all over the world.I must admit my parents weren't big on Fast Food to begin with and I never ate that much of it, but now I will not be eating any of it. My husband is a fast food junky, but I am trying my best to steer him away from it. After reading this book, I made it clear that I better never catch him eating a Fast Food burger.Bottom Line: Extermely interesting book. This should be a mandatory book on high school reading lists."
1,Wonderful,"This was my first time ordering all of my books online for my college classes. I was a bit hesitant not being able to see the books before I purchased them, however, it turns out I didn't need to be. The book was in excellent condition, nothing to hinder my use of it for class. It was also much less expensive than I would have paid at the book store here. I haven't read the book yet, but it looks like it will be a great fit for the class."
0,Useless and poor design,I've used dryer balls for quite some time and I love them. The very first time I used these they came apart at the seam. You have to put them back together every single time you use them. Too much of a hassle when there are better made dryer balls without this flaw at comparable prices. I do not recommend these. As soon as I get new ones they are going in the trash.
0,great story but kindle version is not legible,"While the content was very fascinating, the kindle version was terrible. Most equations and tables were not legible; therefore, difficult to understand. It is a shame that Amazon actually sells it in such a poor form. Is there a way to exchange it for a printed version? If it wasn't for the Kindle version, I would prob. have given a 5 star."
0,This game sucks!!,"This game sucks I cant believe I wasted my $20.00 on this game.You know the saying you shouldnt judge a book by its cover, well the saying is pointing at this game. I mean come on the cover makes the game look very awesome but its not. The cars are ugly and so is the city. I only get 1 game a year until Christmas comes and I wasted my 1 game on this STUPID GAME DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
0,"""Nikayada"" Buddhist tradition","For those who seek to follow the early teachings of the Buddha in the earliest of the suttas and those who follow the modern commentary of John Peacock and Stephen Batchelor, it is only fitting to research their shared resource, K. R. Norman. Mr. Norman, a former foremost distinguished professor of Middle Indo-Aryan or Prakrit at Cambridge, authors a most scholarly approach and commentary to the translation of the early Pali texts. With this as a starting point it becomes more apparent when later revisions or commentary by subsequent writers are added to the cannon. It is not particularly easy reading nor bed time reading; however, it is most important in understanding the later development of the Theravada Buddhist tradition of Buddhagosa in The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) and the Mahayana tradition of Nagajuna and Bodhidharma."
1,Snap-N-Store DVD Storage Boxes,"These storage boxes are awesome! They are affordable, but don't look cheap. The packaging says that they will hold 26 DVDs, but I was able to easily fit a couple more. They are great to put on shelves or just stack on top of each other."
0,NOT A DVI-I CABLE!,"If you're looking for a DVI-I cable, DO NOT buy this product! As a bonus, not only did I receive a DVI-D cable (which lacks the full set of pins, which I need), the cable and the bag it came in had ""HDMI Cable"" printed on them. Epic Fail.Seriously, don't buy this!"
1,And He Gave Pastors,I purchased this book for a class that I am taking in Bible School. It is specifically for Assemblies of God pastors. It is excellent reading for these specific pastors or pastors to be in the Assembly of God church. It is biblically based. I found it to be a bit outdated according to the Assembly of God position in 2010. It was written in 1979. It was in excellent condition for a used book and at a very good price. I will be keeping this book in my library as reference material.
1,The golden age of Arnold,"A fellow weightlifter told me I needed to see this if I was into Arnold at all. It's a classic. I am so I did. It's pretty cool. Seeing the classic TV ""Hulk"" actor was a bonus. It's a brief documentary on part of the competition lead in for a few of the big names back then. If you're into body building history and Arnold, it's worth seeing. It's mostly about the personalities and less about practical tips, although there are some. I've watched it a few times for inspiration since buying it a couple months back. The extras are interesting on this anniversary edition, as the guys reflect on the movie with hindsight."
1,Gu espresso love,"LOVE IT! If one has to eat this stuff, at least it can taste as great as this! The caffeine is also an added bonus."
0,Boooring!!!!!!,"Luckily I saw the movie the before reading the book, because I wouldn't have gone based on the book. The book had the complete opposite effect on me then ""Waiting to Exhale"". I enjoyed reading ""Waiting to Exhale"" but wasn't too crazy about the movie and with ""Stella"" I enjoyed the movie but hated the book.I'm a avid reader by nature and I had a very hard time reading this book, I had to force myself NOT to put it down, I could hardly wait until I was finished, it was far too long and too boring and it seemed that it was written in a rush, and the run-on sentences along with the rambling on and on was quite annoying. It seemed like Terry was trying to reach a quota for the amount of pages that had to be written.I would highly recommend the movie (which I saw 3 times) and I will buy the video when it comes out, but I give the book 2 thumbs down. Refund please!!!"
1,"Worked perfectly on Dish to 47"" LCD TV","I was amazed when this cable was so inexpensive compared to the $158.00 I had to spend to replace it. There was no change in the quality of the HD pictures. I connected my Dish network receiver to my new Visio Flatscreen LCD TV with this Link Depot HDMI cable. It worked perfectly.. amazing.. then I yanked too hard on the end of the cord a couple of times to gain a couple of extra inches.. I pulled the end off the cable. MY FAULT. Unfortunately it was a gift TV that had to be working for Xmas day and since it was the 24th.. off I ran to Best Buy. The only cable in this town to replace it was $158.00. Difference in picture... NONE. Difference in pocketbook.. OUCH! Definitely different in durability, but.. don't yank on it like a rope and it will work fine."
1,Good book and series -- and comparable series,"""Midshipman Bolitho"" is an excellent and early example of this genre. Bolitho is interesting and by starting earlier than C.S. Forrester or Patrick O'Brian the author provides a different perpective. As with many in this genre, Kent convincingly portrays not only the strategic and tactical aspects of the war, but also the ship construction/handling challenges. ""Les Miserables"" its not, but Kent also explores the society of the time and develops a number of interesting and and sympathetic characters. The series maintains its quality over the next 18 or so books. Those interested in discovering other, comparable series should pursue: C.S. Forrester, Patrick O'Brian, Richard Woodman, Dewey Lambdin or James Nelson. Other, harder-to-locate series for the addicts are from Dudley Pope, Porter Hill, Victor Suthren or Frank Eccles. I would welcome information about other similar series -- also other naval eras, army fiction, or merchant marine."
1,"Practice, Practice",I am new to model railroading so everything I buy requires a break in period. It takes awhile to develope your own technique but with practice you will get good results. Most of the time!
1,You must read this book,"Don't let the size of this book seem daunting. It is awfully long but worth ever moment it takes to read it. This book is so full of raw and real emotion that it seems difficult to believe these characters and their lives are merely a creation of Wally Lamb's imagination. I honestly don't know what else to say except this is one of those most beautifully written books I've read. It's truly a piece of art, a masterpiece of literary achievement. Wally Lamb is by far one of the best authors in history in my opinion. He is the only author whose books I've read that made me forget that what I was reading was actually penned by someone and not some mystic commentary on the lives of real people. It's astonishing how seamless his writing is. Without a doubt, this is one of the best books I've ever read."
1,perfect for cat loving preschoolers,"This Cat-shaped book has short, infomative sentences and lovely paintings of kittens going about their daily lives. Charming."
0,Terrible product,The alcohol swabs were totally dry no alcohol on them at all. Tryed 10 or more and same results.Took long time to get them also.Faulty product. Do not order !!!!!Company is hard to reach for complaints and issue unresolved.Not a good experience.
1,Good Reading,Finally you can hear the stories about what happened on the great plains during the westward expansion from the Indian perspective.
0,BORING!,"I had a tough time getting through this book. I really enjoyed previous Carly Phillips books and just finished the Hot Number, Hot Item, etc.. series before I started this book and I have to say, those were above and beyond better than ""Cross My Heart"".The book was boring and the main characters weren't terribly likeable. Thank goodness Hunter and Molly were good supporting characters or this would be a real dud. Stick with previous CF books - it's ok to miss this one!"
0,Not for long hair unless you replace the chain,"The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant."
0,Bottom of the casebook barrel,"At the beginning of this, my first year of law school, I didn't think too much about my actual casebooks. After a couple months, I began to think more about their layout, the organization, case notes, questions, indexes, etc. I began to have favorites, and some that I was less fond of. But until I saw this casebook, I didn't realize casebooks could be so awful. This casebook is badly in need or further organization, better headings, a better table of contents, better editing - in short, all of the details that make or break a casebook.Just to be clear, I am reviewing the second edition, published in 2009. I have also seen the first edition, and the best I can say is that this is, in fact, a significant improvement over the first attempt. But it has a long way to go before any 1L is going to be happy with it."

1,It was worth it for any Sci Fi fan.,"The movies were all good, I have yet to watch the bonus features, but the quality was good. I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in the series if you have not seen them before."
0,A whole lot of nothing,"This book was chosen for a book club and honestly, I was hard pressed to get through it. I expected more out of the author, but even half way through it hadn't turned the corner. One drug deal after another and eachchapter seemed the same to me. Very disappointing."
1,Great Movies,"These are great Extended Editions of the Lord Of The Rings. Excellent Movies!!!!!!!NOTE: The extended editions are over 2 hours long each, but this has the standard edition as well so its no problem."
1,The Corset Diaries,"I love this book. I have given it as a gift to girlfriends. Finally a book about a real size person, that will make you laught and fall in love again and again."
1,Admirer,I had the pleasure to work for Jack Real at Hughes Helicopters. He was very frustrated by all the false information that was produced about Howard Hughes.. I was very pleased to learn he would finally write this book and provide a. factual account of a amazing time..Jack lived an amazing life himself.
1,I love this group!,This is a great group of 7 guys. They love the Lord and know how to show it. I love to listen to their CD's!
0,Disappointing DVD Presentation,"I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of ""unethical"" thing!"
1,"Hey everybody, happy Friday the 13th!","Well it's Friday the 13th, and what better way to spend a night alone in the dark then watching the first 4 Friday the 13th films. Now we all know this is the best, but recommend seeing only the first 4. Watch them alone in the dark."
1,This is banging,"The Album was already enough then they went and added all of Christina pervious videos, including Am To Pm, WHen You Look at me, Dip It Low, Whatever You want...Plus they bouns Cut..Hands on me...this is hot please pick up you'll truly enjoy."
1,This book is so funny I fell off my chair,This book contains many short essays -- the majority of them are excruciatingly funny and also offer thoughtful commentary on Los Angeles life. Reading this book has helped me understand why I find L.A. simultaneously alluring and repulsive. Also the essay on how to analyze someone by the type of earrings they wear has helped me greatly in negotiating parties and social gatherings. You won't regret reading this book.
0,Totally disappointed,This trilogy was recommended to me and I was so disturbed by it. I only read 40 pages and found it to be violent and unpleasant. Pure pornography! I was so uncomfortable with it and I am no prude!
1,For true Roxette Fans,"Yes, the music sounds dated when measured by today's standards, but some songs just seem to live on like Neverending Love. Although not released as a single, So Far Away is a classic ballad. One at least *I* will never tire of..."
1,Great Continuation...Keep Reading,"Aiden and Meg continue to run from the law and Hairless Joe. In the sequel to ""Chasing the Falconers,"" Gordon Korman keeps the action and adrenaline flowing.It's a quick read with lots of action and interesting characters. Grab book #3, ""Now you see them, Now you don't"" before you finish so you can keep the story going."
0,Lacks content,"Indy Cars of the 1950's is disappointing. Nice pictures, but the captions do not really capture the flavor of the period. Technical data is nil, consisting of two pages at the very front of the book. The book unabashedly is tilted towards the products of Frank Kurtis, but contains no anecdotal information, technical discussions, or the like to flesh out the author's admiration. You can read the entire book in a 15 minute sitting. Quite disappointing - Joe Scalzo's book Indianapolis Roadsters 1952-64 is much better resource for this period of Indianapolis 500 history."
1,GREAT!!,"Sister Hazel never ceases to amaze me with the great lyrics, great vocals, and just plain great music. I highly recommend Somewhere More Familiar--it's my opinion that no matter what type of music you like, you will enjoy this CD!"
0,Juvenile sci-fi gimmick film.,"This strangely over-praised (except by me) film is heavy-handed and overdone in all departments, from the over-acting to the ultra-caricatured characterizations to the various ""clever"" time travel ideas. Most viewers are probably not aware that the ideas are all lifted from well-known science fiction writers. A teenage boy of the 1980s travels back to the 1950s and, of course, we get the usual jokes about the absurdity of Ronald Reagan being president, or of a colored boy ever becoming a mayor, etc. The ""circle in time"" gimmick also gets a workout two or three times. (Once would not be enough, of course.) One gag that really is funny is the time traveler's amazement at a super-efficient 1955 filling station."
0,junk,"I recently bought two sets of these from two different company's. Both sets are junk and are going back.The quality of these are not the Brown and Sharpe of the past. The advertised (Parallel within +/-0.0002"" - paired +/-0.0002"") is not true. The 1.5"" pair has deburred edges that has been done with what looks like a deburring buffing wheel. This has left the locating surfaces with rounded over edges. Also the the height difference betweenthe two is .020""(this is not a typo) and not +/- .0002"". I can by cheap China made stuff that is a lot better.Do not waste your money."
0,Author is a biggot!!!,"On page 377 of this book, the author puts in his own opinion of history and I quote, ""The Mormom rebellion against American was over. Plural mariages faded into history, even though a few diviant offshoots of the main Mormon branch secretly kept this practise alive. No doubt, thousands of good Americans siged with relief at the downfall of Satan, and the triumph of American morality.""I'm sorry, to have purchased this book. I assumed this would be a history of law book, but instead found it a disgusting waste of work, from a biggoted author. There was no need to put down any religion, and yet this author mid book, is calling an entire religion ""Satan"" worshippers. What does that opinion have to do with the history of law??? DO NOT BUY!!!"
0,Terrible product!,"I have used Vornado humidifiers & wicks for years, and this product, from Filters Now is bad beyond belief. I don't know what material they are made of, but they definitely do not ""wick"" water up into them. I've tried pre-soaking them, re-soaking them and soaking them in detergent - all to no avail. Within an hour after putting them into use, they are totally dry above the water line in the humidifies, and the room humidity plummets. Do NOT buy this product!"
0,This book is not very good.,"Ms. Resnick's book seems too self-serving and isn't very detail oriented as it relates to how to get started in investing. After reading this book, I still felt lost. I would suggest another book."
1,An awesome great game,"I had been waiting for this game for more then a year when it finally came out. Obviously i had to get the special limited editiion. the black book was great, the silver sharpie reminded me of my old days as a writer. The game was really awesome, i liked the way you can switch the outlines and graff you do, and how you can change the colors of the graff you decide to put up in the in-game black book. Another cool part is that a lot of famous people helped out in this game, like actors and musicians. Overall this game really reminded me of myself and made me want to go out and paint!"
0,It works but it's not worth the price (view comparison below for better alternative),"So i bought a Lexar and an Esecure All in 1 mini card reader. Today i received both and put them to the test.TESTTransfer 4 mov files that total 877mb.

1,Roland Orzabal Strikes Again!!!!!!!!!,"This is Roland's latest single ""Low Life"", which appears on his new and up coming solo album ""Tomcats Screaming Outside"". This CD is a single that promotes his new hit ""Low Life"". The song is literally fantastic and to appeal to the younger generation, it is off the hook! This song has an unusual technoish kind of beat, filled with a monster guitar riff, that you'll catch yourself humming, and it has the usual vocal style of the man himself, Roland Orzabal! A fantastic song by a fantastic artist. I recommend this CD to anyone who is or has been a fan of Tears For Fears *Roland's previous/current band* Songs like ""Shout"" and ""Everybody wants to Rule the World"" rocked the 80s, and ""Low Life"" will rock the new generation of music. New artists are going to have to take a back seat to this song! Way to go Roland!!!!!"
0,"Sorry, not a sparkling gem -- over-rated","(This is my first and probably last review, but I feel strongly about this.) I virtually never buy books new -- but I bought this book based on the 90+ people saying it was fantastic... I expected to be blown away, but have been very disappointed. In addition, the text could be written much 'tighter', there is much superfluous copy, ie, seems to be padded to thicken the book.And to add to other negative reviews saying the Greek is not good, I now notice that the endorsers are not exactly known for their intellectual/theological rigor. I can't help but think that these very influential speakers have influenced some of their closer followers to pump this book.I really wish I had known about the free daily email version -- I'd love my $25 back too! Rick seems to be a great Christian, working in Russia 'n all, but this book doesn't come close to delivering for me. Sorry about that chief."
1,Really enjoyed this book,"I loved Jeff Alt's AT book, A Hike for Sunshine, and I enjoyed this book as well. It made me seriously want to hike the JMT."
0,"GOOD MOVIE, POOR DVD",This product is substandard. The DVD print has scratches. The DVD authoring doesn't allow you to remove the Chinese characters.
1,excellent read,"The book's an excellent read for both the layman and the science student. It successfully combines historical detail with contemporary implications of Drosophila research. Written in a breezy colloquial manner, it never gets boring while sacrificing only little of the scientific content. The author does abuse the fly sex theme, often resorting to it with specious warrant. The other shortcoming of the book has to do with its physical quality, which is horrible. Seedy five-buck pocket-size thrillers are printed on paper of incomparably higher quality. Judged on the content, though - a well-written, informative, and entertaining book."
1,"A strong, disturbing novel","Dark and disturbing, this chilling tale of a young girl's attempt to find unity and love in a chaotic world is an excellent read. It starts far strong than it ends; Butler's message, while never particularly preachy, reiterates itself too many times. Certainly a fine book for any Octavia Butler fan, and a good ""bridging"" book for non-followers of the science fiction genre. It contains an important message without being overly technical/scientific. Well done, Ms. Butler."
0,Waste of money - no power,The rotary wheel stops completely when I touch it to my skin. This product does not work and was a total waste of money. I am very disappointed.
0,What Hurts About Cell is He Was Broken IN Package...,I do not Reccommend This Figure At All...First of All When I first Opened the Blister to Take Cell Out I was Expecting something Great Because He had also Arrived With Vegeta...Vegeta Looks and Performs Rather Well Despite his Right arm Popping off Every Once in awhile...But Cell's Right Arm Was Already Damaged Before I even took it out! The Peg Holding his Arm had been Snapped in Half... The Other Half was still inside the Figure...I Made the Effort to E-mail and See if They'll At Least Send me a Replacement Because Like I said... He isn't Much Used to Me Broken Like this...I do hope They Will Send me the New One... Because this Really Hurts...Only The Second time I've Ever Bought anything from Amazon.com and It's been partly Ruined From a Defective Figurine Broken Before I even got it out of the Blister...How Sad is that?
0,Stay Away Joe,"I purchased this movie because it was the last movie of Elvis's that I did not have and I wanted a collection of all of his movies. I did not like this movie but I still wanted it to complete my collection. I am an Elvis fan and always have been, and I also have a lot his documentaries, so I am happy to have this last movie. Would I recommend this movie? To a real Elvis fan, yes, but to someone wanting to see a good movie, no."
0,Very dissapointed.,"I was looking forward to seeing a favorite series in a movieformat and I thought surely that it would be done with some measure ofcompetence. I could not have been more wrong. The story line is rushed. Subplots are just thrown in without substance. Perhaps its just the dubbing, but the dialogue is laughable. I'd give this film a negative rating if I could."
1,always a good time.,I was turned on to Venture Bros. by my girlfriend. I must say I'm quite the fan now.
1,Good book,"This book is about a family living in Flint, Michigan who are having difficulty with their son Byron. Byron is fascinated with starting fires and seems to always be getting in trouble. The book is pretty good and a little funny. I recommend it to middle school students. Wade Cloyd-Mason County Middle School-8th grade"
0,not up to par,"I am a big Stephen King fan, and have been reading his stuff (sometimes over and over again) for over 30 years. I am listening to this one, and I have to say that I agree that the cutsie-pie language is incredibly annoying. It is so repetitive and annoying that it takes away from the story. It makes it difficult to get through and prevents me from caring at all about the characters. It is very disappointing and all i want to do is yell ""Shut up!"" I'm plowing through it because it is mildly interesting. Definitely will not read this one again..."
0,BUYER BEWARE,"Not going to spend a lot of time here, but I would not buy another DeLonghi product because of my experience with this product. R.E. Kraus, and 1 other reviewer nailed it. My unit lasted about 10-11 months until it too started leaking water all over the counter. My wife and I unfortunately did not call DeLonghi Customer Service at that time, but after the reviews here on Amazon, I'm confident they would have not stood by their product. I did end up calling their customer service a couple weeks ago, the unit being about a year and half old, and they did nothing, stating it was out of warranty."
0,Charles And Me,"The book is boring, boring, boring! Pat Shannon is a TERRIBLE writer. It seems as if she has a thesaurus right next to her as she writes - - trying to insert the most obscure, complicated word possible. I purchased the book seeking information about CHARLES, and since his name was first in the title, I figured this was what I wanted. It wasn't. She made it as complicated (mainly about herself) as possible. This was the only book I could find on his secret love with Pat. I just had hoped for more. Probably a third person should have written the book, but obviously there wasn't one. I would never recommend this book to anyone, even if you are a Charles Kuralt fan."
0,Cindy Crawford DVD,I ordered this item well over a month ago and this is the second review I had gotten to do to tell you I still Have NOT received this item. I know the mail can be slow.....but I don't think it has even been sent yet!! Is this item available??? Just wondering!!
0,"Nice unit, terrible customer service","I bought this humidifier at the beginning of November as the weather began to getting colder and the humidity level dropped. On the third night while filling the water tank, it slipped from my hands and fell inside of the bathtub shattering into a dozen pieces. I have been in touch with Holmes customer service and both by phone and e-mail. The person on the phone told me the replacement tanks were back ordered until after Christmas and the person who corresponded with me by e-mail stated that it was December 14th. I continue to correspond by e-mail to see if the item has arrived, but I only receive ""canned"" responses from their customer service folks. The unit worked great for the first two nights I used it, but as of now, I'm out over $70 (with shipping) with a humidifier I can't use."
1,Hard to find,"This CD was discontinued and is extremely hard to find, but thanks to amazon i found it! the CD was awesome too!"
0,Great family movie,"I love to watch this movie with my grandchildren, they love it and I do too.Buy it you will enjoy it too."
1,Fun Learning Toy,"Purchased a set for my Head Start classroom, and think I may have to get another one. Really popular with my little ones who just aren't old enough for traditional learning styles. These gears are great for individual or cooperative group projects, lend themselves to creative and ingenious configurations, and encourage persistence. Imagine what the kids could do with twice as many to work with! I did leave off the decals that came with the set - entirely too much visually."
0,NO PAC NO HIT,"PAC JUST BEING ON 2 TRACKS ON A DOUBLE CD JUST DON'T STRETCH THE SALES. DEATH ROW SHOULD BE ON DEATH ROW. PAC WOULD BE ASHAMED TO SEE HIS POETIC MASTERMIND LACED OVER SOME WACC TRACKS LIKE THESE. AMERICA DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, MORE IMPORTANTLY YOUR TIME. THIS IS A NO BRAINER AND WHEN YOU SEE IT LEAVE IT ON THE SELVES. R.I.P. 2-PAC AKA MAKAVELLI"
0,Thought it'd be funny,I thought it would be funny but the thing is that the dye is inside of a small backdoor on the soap. The opening is covered with a piece of white cloth or tape or some kind of fabric. It takes a few times of use perhaps in the shower before the dye starts coming out. Either way its black dye and basically I don't think this prank can go unnoticed with the way they back opening is on the soap. darn!
0,Unappealing,The story is mediocre and the illustrations are somber and static. This book was a great disappointment to my child.
0,FAKE,"please dont buy it,its fake... ive been using this product long enough to say!Usually fake perfumes smeel just like original but the fragrance goes away soon,but this one give me a headache and is nothing like the original"
1,Review for Charred Souls,This book was very helpful to me and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to anyone.
0,One of the worst ppvs in years!,"Armageddon 2003 was one of the worst wwe ppvs in years! The best match was RVD vs. Orton, and the wasn't even good because Orton sucks!DONT BUY!!!!!!!"
1,Love it!,"The kids stay focused when I read this, they like the pictures and can relate to the story. The story has a nice flow to it. It's a great tool for helping little ones understand fruit of the spirit."
1,Honest,"My intesrest in this book stemmed from reading Michael Datcher's ""Rasising Fences"" where he mentioned this book. I read it in 3 nights. It was a real page turner-a must read!! I kinda got the feeling though, that it was to be continued...Overall, it was a touching, honest story and I recommend it."
0,Don't Bother!,"Great idea, but does not deliver any results. The one positive is that it taste pretty good, so maybe after a spicy lunch, this will freshen your breath. It won't whiten your teeth. Go the professional route."
1,"Solid stool, well built","I use this at a stand-up desk, so I'm only sitting in it for a few minutes at a time. Just as well, since the seat is somewhat uncomfortable, rather hard and clearly not intended to be sat in for long periods. That's OK, though, since that's not the point... Overall a serviceable, well-made stool for the money. Very stable, with a wide range of height. The foot rail is easily adjusted and strong - I can stand on it with only a little noticeable deflection.Pros: Durable, simple, easy to assemble, clean lines, stable, easy and big height adjustmentCons: Uncomfortable seat"
0,ice maker,The ice maker made ice but it tasted like plastic and after 5 months the ice maker started to leak and from the bottom of the machine.
0,Totally Disappointing,"As a fan of James Webb, I was surely surprised at this slow reading novel. Lost Soldiers is only a history/geography lesson of Viet Nam, Thailand, Hawaii, Russia and Australia that concludes with a predictable and disappointing climax. Let's hope that his fuure work is better than this one."
1,Complete Book of Knots,This book has every knot that you can imagine. The descriptions are good. It is still going to be easier to go on line and see an animated knot but every sailor should own this book.
0,Lopsided negatively... And who on earth edited this thing??,"This is a pretty awful book... I could have written a better one... The authors portray Dusty as emotionally needy, and there is precious little in the book to suggest that the authors even liked Dusty. Whoever edited this thing should find a different line of work. It reads like a lengthy and very poorly written tabloid article! I wish that someone would write more balanced portrait of this artist. It seems that any literature on Dusty is either ""sugar-coated"" or trashy. This book falls in the trashy category. I only hope that the upcoming film of Dusty's life will be more balanced, and sympathetic towards its subject."
1,terrific ABC book,"My daughter (almost 2 years old) adores this book! We borrowed it from our library and it quickly became a part of her bedtime routine. It is simple with not a lot of overwhelming colors, patterns, shapes, etc. Just the alphabet and some cute dogs. It has helped us in teaching her to pronunciate her letters. I had to add it to her Amazon wish list because I'm not sure we can give it back to the library? lolI definitely recommend this as a great ABC board book!"
0,Do not buy,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she loves to sing and dance and it was a really good price. When we receive this she turned it on by hitting the buttons and you could barely hear the music I thought the batteries were low so I changed them, and it didn't do any good. You can't hear the music only if it is really quite in the room and when you sing in the microphone you can't hear it very good either.This toy ended up in the toy box with all of the other toys my daughter won't play with."
1,What a great movie...,"This movie was just fantastic, hands down. Didn't expect much, but I was laughing through out the whole movie. Bill Nighy is great as quentin and not to mention philip seymour hoffman."
0,Not Travel Friendly,"Bought this for world travel, however, the strange shape makes it cumbersome for packing in the backpack. Works good on the nightstand at home, but for packing, find a more compact model."
0,Zero stars?,"A ridiculous attempt to appear as a master ""scholar"" of English studies. Thuman casts a superficially critical eye on a number of the leading figures in rhetoric and composition, and the result is just one more dull book-report. Enough of these useless tomes, already."
0,Wish I hadn't spent the money,"I was excited about this saw when it first arrived, and it worked well until the warranty expired. When it went out of square, the autorized repair shop, with direction from Bosch, quoted over $350 to fix and said even that might not do it. They said it had been dropped or run over by a truck, both of which would be difficult since the saw had been on a stand since it was new. The shop recommended the Makita which surprisingly is made in America. I won't be looking to Bosch for quality equipment."
1,Excellent for Preparing for the Security+ test,"I read a few different books while preparing for the Security+ test, and this one is the best of the bunch. The book really matches up to the Security+ objectives well. I have nothing to say but good things about this book. I would recommend it to anyone fixing to take the Security+ test or just entering computer security."
0,You have to be easily entertained to like this garbage.,"Thank god they took this off the air. I bought this DVD without ever having seen the series before. It's terrible. 4/6 episodes are just completely worthless. Two are decent, including the one based on a Heinlein story. Let me say it this way: Stephen Hawking is the host. WTF? Why would you have a guy who can't talk as a host??? This show was poorly made from the beginning."
1,Extremely good book,"Difficult to put down. Just when I thought it was over,there was another twist and the chase was still on."
1,Good information,"A good variety of information that cover just about every aspect to technical theatre. Clear and concise explanations are given, enough to get the gist of it."
0,The English Dubbing Killed the Movie,"For an old Chinese kung fu movie, it is not bad for the fighting scenes; but the English dubbing made the characters sound idiotic."
1,----,"This being My Morning Jacket's first Album, it is easy to understand the shoddy recording. If you can get past this fact, below you will see the beautiful songs accompanied by Jim James' amazing and haunting voice. Be sure to pay extra attention to song 3, The Bear, which i believe to be the best song on the album. This is a great CD for the existing My Morning Jacket fan. If you are looking to just start listening, this cd may make them harder to appreciate due to the amatuer recording. And, believe me, this band affords appreciation."
1,Inspiring,"This book was a remarkable story of a woman's strength. As I recall the shooting of over 20 years ago, I remember how eventually we all went on with our lives and didn't think about the ways in which one young man with a gun changed so many lives forever that day at the Hilton Hotel in DC. Sarah Brady made it her personal mission to put the NRA out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever. I would recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by the dedication and will of others and would like to change the world for the better."
0,I want to be like Mike,"If you have ever enjoyed a column written by Mike Royko you will love this book. If you have never read a column by Mike Royko then you have the opportunity to experience the joy of seeing the last third of the twentieth century America through his unique view as well as the pleasure of watching an artist at work. With no apologies to Mr. Jordan, Royko is the most talentd Mike to ever work in Chicago."
1,Cute movie!,I was a freshman in high school when this came out and I absolutely loved it! Just a funny funny cartoon. Very cute wish it was available on DVD!
0,"Read SB 1 or God by Maddox, more indepth","The speculations throughout this book are very disquieting. Not in the sense that they are possible, but these speculations are truly just that, one hundred percent speculative. The research done is nothing more than general background history which absolutely has no direct connection to Jesus Christ. I do not support or reject Jesus, I only support what is fact and this book goes no further than the New Testament had done for years. The questions posed, such as ""Did Jesus really die on the cross or did he have a spouse,,,are rambled about here with added speculation. I am continually surprised at what the publishing industry prints, better read Karl Maddox, SB 1 or God, Jesus gets a scientific and historic breakdown, nothing beats it."
1,Annie,"A great movie for the whole family if one can overlook the overacting by the cast which actually consists of some very fine actors and actresses. Aileen Quinn as Annie is adorable and does a great acting job. My family representing 3 generations - children, parents and grandparents - had a wonderful time watching this together. The two children, ages 5 and 8, are very sensitive and get easily scared by scary scenes, even in so-called family movies. But this one they greatly enjoyed, sitting on the edge of the sofa because of the suspense but not getting scared or traumatized. This is a true feel good movie for all ages."
1,well...it works....,"There is not much one can say about a cord...it either works or it doesn't.This one works.It is 25 ft long (which is long enough to reach across most rooms with ease) and the cord itself is thick, thicker than standard S-Video cables, so it should stand up to abuse.If you feel compelled to abuse a cable, that is.Um, so yeah...it works."
1,Gatorskin Nitrile glove,"I like these gloves because they are tough for working around tools, paint and other chemicals. They lasted a lot longer before wearing out or breaking at the thumbs and forefingers.The only drawback is the medium size is a tight fit, somewhat smaller than typical for a size medium. Next time I will order a large in that brand."
1,35 & TICKING,"OMGoodness! This movie is funny, im finding out kinda, tardy for the partyish, howeva ima need that soundtrack. What, they don't have one published...help !"
0,Broken without ability to repair,"I used my Oster to blend frozen smoothies. It worked okay. It would eventually get the ice and frozen fruit to blend, but it required a lot of stopping and stirring. It was really loud (but most blenders are). After about 5-6 months of smoothie making, the shaft/axel that goes from the motor to the blades sheered off. As far as I can tell, Oster doesn't sell replacement parts for that problem."
1,"Love it, love it",This scent has been around awhile and it never gets old. I have received so many compliments when layering this with the perfume. The price was very affordable.
0,Disappointing,"As a great lover of BBC period pieces, I came to this one with high hopes, despite its cancellation. However, there was a reason it was cancelled. The scripts are not good. The acting is fine, the sets are great, the overall conception is a good one, and expectations were high. But it is annoying. They needed to hire Davies or someone to come in and save this thing, but they didn't. It is not worth a second viewing, except under extreme boredom, and therefore it is probably not worth buying the DVD (unless you have a crush on someone in the cast)."
0,What went wrong?,"What makes a gripping story? I honestly find it hard to pin down...I remember reading some of the battle scenes in Steven Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"", and actually leaping out of my bed to pace until my heart stopped racing. I was hoping that ""Men of Bronze"" would provide a similar experience, but I'm disappointed.I can't sympathize with any of the characters; the battle scenes are cookie cutter; the descriptions of the surroundings and characters, somehow lacking. I found myself reading with a vague detachment, as if eating a bag of Doritos when I'm really not hungry. And I like Lays better than Doritos.So, mildly dissatisfied, I'm putting the book down before I finish it. I don't want to say that it's a bad book...it just didn't awaken my appetite for more."
1,A Classic Resource for the Serious Bible Student,"In addition to the Bible , the four basic key aids for study are a bible atlas, bible dictionary, concordance, and last but not least a good handbook. After some research, it was clear that Halley's was far and away the most revered and trusted. I found most useful the background and history of biblical people and events that which have made the scriptures come alive. I am amazed how he packed so much information in this relatively small volume. Highly Recommended."
0,Big Top Pee-Wee,"The movie was not new. It had an extremely faded cover, labels from another location, and the tape was wrinkled. I was very disappointed."
1,Soldiers Live,"Fantastic Journey! I started reading the series one year ago when I was stationed in Korea. I still love book one the best of all the books but I also enjoyed the journey across Glenn Cook's world. Having served as a light and mechanized infantrymen, my feet and posterior hurt all the way through as I read about the company's journeys. The author did an outstanding job of describing the day to day misery of living in the field as a soldier and the bonds of loyalty that develop between men from this shared experience. I was sorry to see all the old and new faces get killed off, but such is the life of a mercenary. I strongly urge Mr. Cook to continue his good work. Once a brother, always a brother. Thanks for an incredible ride.Ground Pounder"
1,"depraved, but....enertaining.....","i, honestly, am not a moral person. but this book is simply the most shocking thing i have ever read. yes, comparasions to nabakov are valid, but ""lolita"" was nothing, nothing at all like this. the storyline is enough to provoke some uneasy feelings, but the writing itself is a whole other thing. i honestly kept the book off for a while because of it.however, the narrative and detail are stunning. incredibly stunning. one would think it would be on the same level as some patended supermarket trash novel, but it's nowhere near it. it moves briskly, is accessable, and weaves the storyline masterfully.so, overall: good book, but disturbing amorality/depravity/whatever you like to call it can often lead to less-than-favorable thoughts of the book."
1,good CD,"I bet you're thinking...""Pokemon? That's something my first grade brother likes."" So true--but even though I think the poke craze is a little ridiculous, this CD is great. M2M's ""Don't Say You love me"", Christina Aguliara's ""We're a Miracle"", Ashley Ballard & So Plush's ""It was You"", and Angela Via's ""Catch me if you can"" are really great songs on this cd. So is Billie's ""Making my way (any way I can.) get this CD! it rocks!"
0,HELPFULL IF YOU ARE BUYING A SCOPE,"I bought this book to compare the different products out on the market. I was mainly interested in a rifle scope, but the sections on binoculars and spotting scopes looked complete to me. What I got was a comparism of scope prices, features and specs. I felt this really helped in making my choice. THe scopes were divided into sections for varmit shooting, dangerous game etc. About the only thing I could say is that there are no street prices listed but admitedly this is tough to do because there always is a lower price out there.All in all a great investment for below 25 bucks."
0,"patronizing, fake sounding","This book is superficial and preachy. It is filled with stock answers and suggestions which turned me off and turned off the people I showed them to. It's hard to believe that teenagers would want to read beyond the first page.I also found the language elementary, and the grammar occasionally incorect. Answers to common questions were surfacy. This is a great title with very weak back up in the text. I work in a school as a counselor and have a teenage child, and I'd never give this book to anyone who really wanted the lowdown."
0,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"I loved it the first day ! Then it locked up on me and I couldnt get it to do anything. It finally fixed itself and the next day while charging it it locked up again. It just froze ! The display says "" connecting "" and there it stayed until the battery died and I wasnt able to do anything else with it. JUNK ! JUNK ! JUNK !I tried to contact Sandisk....yeah right they were no help !"
1,Great Book for the Young and Old Reader,"This book definitely lives up to all the movie and media hype. J.K. Rowling is brilliant and Stephen Fry is thrilling. We decided to listen to these on audio-book while driving, cleaning and working, watching the first movie afterwards. The storyline is engaging and enthralling from the beginning. Magic begins almost immediately, quickly pulling the audience into the mysterious life of Harry Potter. Stephen Fry is capable of a wide range of voices; just when you think he can't possibly read as another new character, he excitingly does it. We worried we might be too old to enjoy this series, but Rowling is such a genius author that she writes at a level enjoyable to all ages. Bravo! Read this book and then watch the coinciding film. The movies never please every fan, especially the hardcore ones, but it's always great to see the characters come to life in cinema."
1,Very poignant.,"""The Man Without a Face"" is a very sad and emotional book, but it is one that will stay with you. Having a rebellious 14-year-old boy as the narrator was a wise choice, especially because of the time period, which is 1972. This story involves a platonic love between a disfigured man and an emotionally distraught boy. The trials and tribulations they both go through with one another is bumpy, but worth it. The era seems too far-fetched, but probably likely. The boy's family life is shameful and problematic (although it is not entirely his fault). And the ending is a sad one, and will leave you thinking about the entire story. A remarkable book. I recommend."
1,Great - Exactly What I Needed,What more can I say about these? They're plain old medicine cups. I've had these for a while and have no problems.
1,Total Enjoyment,"This is my first Calder Willingham read, but it certainly will not be my last. I like his southern style, choice of eccentric characters, subject matter...discriptive and brilliantly constructed. I look forward to reading more."
1,Viewtiful Joe: Good game but a good guide?,"I recently picked up this guide to compliment my purchase of the game Viewtiful Joe and this is what I think of it. As I first opened it I noticed it is very colorful which is a great thing and the guide was very helpful. The only cons are that it is very thin with 112 pages. I was dissapointed at how short the secrets section was though. Overall, I'd say any Joe fan that needs help to beat that hard boss or just to read it for fun should pick it up because it is very colorful and detailed."
1,Wires and Wood,Saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great. This is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
0,didn't work for me-No Mac support,was supposed to work with Mac but didn't and horrible support. Buyer beware!
1,Watery But Good Glue,Be sure to hold pieces together for a minute before releasing. Very good glue but a bit watery. The glue will not keep for more that a couple of hours after opening - the caps are useless - so plan to use the entire little container. Use very little or it will take a while to setup.Well worth the effort.
0,Didn't work too well for me,"It was good while it was working well, until it started to leak fluid through the fins. Took me a while to figure out why the whole front end of my Xterra is covered in transmission fluid and on the ground. Turns it was this cooler leaking. Not sure why, must be defective. It worked for two months. Now I have look for a different cooler."
1,Handy to keep in the car.,"The factory charger cord finally crapped out, and this one fits the cigarette lighter snugly without slipping out. It does what It's supposed to."
0,"May do the job, but expect problems.","This is a good machine if you only need to weld a few times a year. As far as reliability, its a lot less than what you would get from a Lincoln or Miller of the same size. Hobart is a division of Miller and ITW. From the inside they are bare simple, but all the parts are extremly cheap. Expect problems. I's suggest purchasing a Lincoln or Miller since they're built with better parts for the money. After the warranty is out you want something thats built to last with few problems."
1,"This workout is great, but there are a few problems","The weight lifting section is wonderful. There are some new techniques that really get to muscles very effectively. The pace is great, also. It moves quickly from one move to another, enhancing your workout.There are two problems I have with the format of the dvd that caused my rating to loose a star. First, you cannot access just the ab section from the main menu. Also, the ""ball"" routine that was advertised on the jacket and beginning of the dvd were not included on my copy at all. There is no mention of it on the menu, nor does it play at the end of the workout. I have no idea what happened to that section.Good routines, but a few flaws."
0,I Had To Return Mine,"I bought mine new, but it looked as if someone had already opened the box by the time I got it. On top of that, the light bulb didn't work and one of the base clamps was bent. I sent it right back for a refund.I thought I would save some money with this particular model (The picture looked good), but I think I'll spend a little more next time and hopefully get something that works."
0,Unusable zippers,I returned this trunk because the zippers (all zippers) were so stiff they either could not be used or took a lot of time effort to unzip.
0,B.O.R.I.N.G,"I did not like this book at all.The book was boring& too predictable.I really didnt like Spinneli's writing.He got into too many details.I did not like the plot of this story.That he was a poor orphan kid.I would not recommend this book to other people.I dont know about any of his other books but this one was terrible.That includes my reveiw of the very, very, boring book of Maniac Magee"
0,Very Disappointed,"After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity, on 12/11/06....Today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message ""DRUM NEAR END"" There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished..I certainly have NOT printed 25,000 copies..."

1,Great workout and gift!,This is a great stocking stuffer for those wanting to explore ballet and home training. A MUST HAVE for a great workout at any level.
0,Complaints of volume from the other end.,"I was able to adjust to everything else on this headset (weight, difficulty of wearing and the unusable power button) but every now and then the person at the other end only hears a faint voice even when I am talking at the top of my voice. Not sure what the problem is but it's quite annoying. I am not using this one anymore and am off to try some of those motorola ones.My review should be taken with a pinch of salt given that this is the only headset I have ever had. Not sure if others are better/worse than this. But this is the only problem I have with this headset. I am using this with a Motorola-Razor V3."
1,My 8th graders liked it!,"To supplement a chapter that focuses on the ""big three"" - Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster, I showed the beginning and end of this film to my 8th graders. They liked it very much. It helped me show how guys like D. Webster were larger than life in their life time and after. I enjoyed the black and white and the Citizen Kane-ish style, but I think this movie could be redone with contemporary stars and effects. It would be cool. If you like history and old movies, it's a good buy."
1,Great Advice,I read Steve's book and am looking forward to using his advice in my future trading. The way he explains investing in options makes it easy to understand. I recommend reading this book.
0,Not the best toy out there,"We got this for my daughter last Christmas, when she was 16 months old. She did enjoy putting the balls in the basket and watching them spin down, but the bat/golf club were completely useless. She never did do anything with the attached balls except sometimes spin them with her hand. Plus, this toy takes up a fair amount of space for what it is. I would say, skip this one and keep looking!"
1,Facial Treatment,My daughter requested a Microdermabrasion kit for Christmas and I am sure she will love this one by Revlon.
0,Great German Recipes,Contains the most popular German recipes. Recipes seem to be consistent but instructions are not detailed. Probably would not have purchased the book if I had seen it beforehand.
1,Just what I wanted,"I have been using MySQL for years and it's easy to get by with the basic SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements. Recently I discovered the powers of JOIN statements and realized how much more was possible. I have only read a few chapters of this but I'm already impressed. It's just what I wanted because it gives you the syntax and gritty details of each feature without getting tedious and turning into a 1000 page reference manual.I can already tell I'm going to be poking around this book for years to come. I think this does a great job of filling in the gaps for someone who can already write a basic SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT statement but is looking for more. Seems good from a new user perspective too but if you haven't at least looked at some online tutorials and tested some basic statements for yourself then I would recommend doing that and then reading this book immediately afterward."
1,Larry Blamire Repeats His Genius Again!,"Larry Blamire and his wonderful cast of characters outdid themselves in this sequel. If you liked The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, you'll love this movie. Watch it, then be sure to watch it with the commentary. The man truly is a genius! If you have not seen the original, but love old B monster movies, buy them both and enjoy! You won't be sorry and you won't be able to stop laughing."
1,Works well,"I have used this spray for over 5 years to lubricate door and window locks hinges and locks in several seaside homes. It goes on easily and cleanly (not so for graphite based lubricants), and is nearly invisible once it dries. Although the cans look small, they last and last. The products also keeps out rust , which is a real problem for shore houses."
0,This book is a triple bogey....,"As a long-time fan of Bill Murray, I was completely disappointed by this book...the anecdotes never rise above the mundane. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once while reading the book, nor did I once note in an appreciative manner a particularly deft turn of phrase. The Bill that comes across is a know-it-all kind of stuck in his ways, the guy who's undeniably brilliant but probably not that much fun to be around."
1,Not the right size but that was my fault,"This product is great. It is very sturdy however, it was the wrong size. Completely my fault. I did not return it because it can be reused in so many ways. Right now we are using it to hold all our daughters outside toys. It was originally purchased to be an outside bath tub for my dog but she got too big.I am very satisfied with it regardless.Thank you"
0,Soft but SHEDS,This blanket is nice and soft and I liked it at first. That was until I discovered how much it sheds. I tried washing it a couple of times just to get the extra threads out but it didn't work. It still sheds like crazy! To Goodwill it goes!
0,not reliable quality,"I guess I also got a defective torch! it takes 10-15 tries to get the torch to light, and the flame is hard to keep lit, when it does stay lit, I can't seem to get any sort of melting without lighting the sugar on fire and charing it. perhaps I'm using it wrong, but the directions are VERY vauge. the ramekins are great, but the torch...Do yourself a favor and do what the pros do, go down to your local hardware store and buy a butane torch. it'll run you about $10, and the fuel is included."
0,Not recommandable!,"I bought this video about a year ago in a local department store. I watched it at home, and needed to stop it after only a few minutes. The instructor was not the type of person that I would like leading a fitness routine. I didn't liked the choreography of the moves, and the people in the backround where doing different moves. So there was no way for me to ever try even doing the fitness routine. I was lucky to sell it to another person! I would not recommand buying this video!"
1,Great for adding space to a small room by going vertical,"I got these to create some space for a 13' X 13' room at a brick and mortar store about 10 years ago. They've withstood banging, burning, dust, and stacking. I put everything in them clothing, tools, stationary, you name it. I like the stackability of the drawers along with the durability of the plastic they're made from. They stack well on carpet or bare floors. However, next time I may just get the doors with the shelves, but I'll like these."
1,The work and life of the psychotherapist Dr Hayao Kawaii,"A fascinating and clearly written explanation of the introduction of Jungian Psychotherapy into Japan, its transformation into the mainstream of counseling and group therapy practice and the teaching of psychology, and the influence of the life and work of Dr. Hayao Kawai in the planting of Analytical Psychotherapy into Japan and the promotion of integration of a broad range of psychotherapies in the service of the people of Japan. Still as timely and thought provoking as when it was first published in Japan, it is a book that makes one question the wisdom or otherwise of adhering solely to a single school of psychotherapy in the service of our clients and patients."
0,What happened????,I bought this game used at a Gamestop so luckily I didn't spent much on it. The game sucks so don't waste your money. It amazes me that the makers of the game would produce a product with less graphics and features than the first. Doesn't make sense to me. It makes me unsure if I want to waste my money on Offroad Fury 3..I guess I'll wait until I hear some positive reviews.
0,Still Garth,"Not as original as I thought it would be, still sounds like Garth, but the thinner look is nice."
0,No bang for the buck,"I have always used these and thought I had one for this year's winter season. When I found I didn't, I was about to order one until I saw the price. WAAYYY too expensive for the purpose. I'm sure they do what they're supposed to, but what are they - solid platinum? I will listen to the reviewer who used a furnace filter and duct tape. I can't believe I ever used these unless they were much cheaper when I used them before.Spend your twenty bucks on a replacement wick, this is ridiculous."
0,You really have to enjoy stupidity,"I, like everyone, enjoy a good comedy but there comes a point when it just gets too stupid for me to finish watching it. This movie ""for me"" went beyond stupid. I shut it off after the first 15 minutes."
1,He's Back!,"Thank God he's back! This is a wonderful CD! He really got back to who Kenny is. I think. I think he's finally back to being country, not that he ever wasn't really it just doesn't have that island edge he'd seemingly come to be all about. Yay!!"
0,Coffee Table book,"Looks good. The page layout has a 4x4 picture on one side and a brief description on the other side (1-4 sentences) about each building. The book can be very off on the adress; an example being Morphosis, Caltrans 7 HQ. In the book it's address is 312 North Spring Street, well on the side of the building is a 2 story size carving of the address that states: 100. It's actually at 1st and Main, which you can make out in the 4x4 picture in the book. Hard to get that wrong, but they did. Also, I was looking for purely architecture, not caring too much for interiors, but really wanted old LA and New. This book goes into some newly remodeled spaces and just new architecture from the last 8 years. So all in all it's cute book."
0,"Really, really bad!","As a writer, Hoyle is justly forgotten now and the Fifth Planet is really incredibly bad, so bad it's almost funny!"
1,A Must for all employees!!,"I would recommend this as a required text for all college students who wish to be employed anywhere. The book is very well written, easy to read and has up to date analogies. It clearly illustrates how teams work and how to communicate effectively within a team. I will be keeping this book in my library!"
0,items purchased,The Cd came and I was very excited to listen to it.. Only to find the music to another artist whom i did NOT like. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
0,Different from the pictured bear,"I was looking to purchase a ""backup"" bear for the Melodies Gund Bear that my son is currently using. I tried first at my local stores, but they all have the newer version of the bear. Different texture ""fur"", different color eyes, no bow but instead has a ""tattooed"" paw and not as stuffed. I purchased this one from Amazon because the bear pictured is the same bear that my son owns. Fingers crossed, I placed my order and waited for the bear to show up. It arrived on time so no complaints - I was quite happy...until I opened the box. What?! It was the newer version of the Gund Bear. The bear in itself is great. The melodies are sweet and the 3 levels of volume are fantastic. The duration (approx. 15 mins) is more than enough to soothe your child. The bear is a great purchase if, IF, this is your first melodies bear but not if you are looking to replace your child's current gund bear (older version pictured)."
1,"It's whedon, the guy is gold","cool story and art, a tad violent and dark but tough guys can take it - gotta get whedon and gaiman together on a movie"
1,Moving! Energetic! Loud! I can listen to this all day!,"I thought the collection of songs were great! Hip-hop still doesn't stand a chance against Journey even today! It's too bad they aren't around anymore though. With this CD, I can drive a classic car across America and play this summer-seasoned music yearly!"
1,BUY THIS,This product works great. Burns a long time and does not smell. Do not waste your money on any other products. I have tried them and they are horrible.
0,NOT for walking!,"I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I'd read about them, however, these are not walking shoes! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street. They haven't much cushioning, had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight. The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off. Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe. So far, Nike Air Max has provded the best results (for me).Hope this review helps."
0,Unable to Install - poor Web Site Experience,"Purchased this web cam as an update. Have had and used many web cams. It works well on the Mac but on the PC I can not get the INF file to initialize. Worst part is the very cryptic support web site (after spending 30 minutes carefully providing the problem along with screen shots, the Web site invalidates due to a faulty Phone number format (3 times until I simply gave up).Lastly, the drive CD was so warped it would not read (or spin)requiring me to download the drivers.I have used many web cams and have had no problems - now this one is in the rubbish bin as I now purchase a different make. Fool me once, shame on you."
1,Review!,I got this for a Halloween costume (Lethal Weapon) and this worked perfectly. It is metal and looks/feels real enough.
0,Once Fobidden,Extremely disappointed in this book - This is the 2nd in a series - The 1st one was great - This one was TERRIBLE!!! What a waste of my time and money
1,I miss Harvey,"I first heard this while at a public radio station in Alaska. I hadn't heard from Harvey Mandel in years and I was happy to see he still had it. I hope your doing well in Crested Butte, Harvey. I guess you've gone back to the blues like all the old dudes do. I'll miss your unique fusion of rock, blues and jazz."
0,Dont Buy,"I wish I would have just watched this on tv or even rented it, not worth money or adding to my dvd collection. Movies like this are exactly why I don't purchase alot anymore."
1,Thomas continues to charm children,"Children love Thomas the Tank Engine. They love to watch it over and over, and I have to say, even for grownups, the first time can be entertaining!"
1,Yes for sure it's a great book,If you are a beginner; Sometimes Mr Small go fast but it's the good to refine you search for knowledge. If not: Great ! Peter gives a chance to your dreams. Even if you want to learn Java it's probably one of the best starts. I think it's time for Peter to write a novel about programming. It's great to spend my money and feel richer.
1,I love this game!,Fun game! Wish the cards were a little thicker but a good product for this day and age (disposable).
0,DONT BUY THIS,I am a big Madden fan but this game is just bad. Madden 2001 is ten times better. there are a couple new cool features on this game but other wise its horrible! The off season features are exactly the same and there are never any good players. the best player is overall rated 75. this game is just bad.
1,strength training anatomy,Great book at a great price. Everyone I've shown it to goes out and buys it. The illustrations in it are so perfect even if you knowwhat you are working out it is an awesome resource to access simply because it is so full of detail.
1,recommend,"fast shipping, product work fine, my new vacuum cleaner parts supplier! i have a eureka contour model no longer made. parts and acc. hard to find they had it . I wish i knew about this company before i ordered more items from a more expensive company who had to back order. it took 3 weeks to get them. ezvacuum company has fast free shipping and great prices. thanks"
1,"For looks, It can't be beat... durability, however...","...is something completely different. It looks great, but the cocking action itself gave out after a few months. And it probably isn't the most powerful thing in the airsoft world, but you can't beat this price!!!"
1,Great Idea,"Although I don't own this item just yet, I'll be putting one on my model 77 Skilsaw that I purchased on eBay as soon as it gets here."
0,Defective merchandise.,Cable would not fit in DVI-D due to defective merchandise. Outside of port was bent beyond repair. Sent in for refund right away. Very disappointed.
1,Coffie shop at home,"There was a coffee shop near where I worked. They served the best Spiced Chai Tea Latte. Unfortunately, my office moved locations, but I need my Chai fix. One day when I was back in the area of the coffee shop I saw what they were using to make their Chai. It was Big Train. I've been buying this ever since. I love this so much more than the Tazo Chai that they fix at Starbucks. I just make mine with hot water and its good. You'll have to make it into a Latte to get the full coffee shop experience. Hot water or Latte it still tastes the same. My wife who is a coffee drinker says its too sweet or sugary. I've never had a taste for coffee, but I absolutely love this Spiced Chai and have gotten several people at work hooked; your welcome Big Train :)"
1,"Excellent sequel to ""Silk""... beautifully written","If you enjoyed ""Silk"", you won't be disappointed with this work. It meets or exceeds the quality of it's predecessor. As always, Kiernan compellingly meanders through beautiful and creepy realities and experiences telling the tale of Niki, Dar, and Spyder. One has difficulty not taking pleasure from Kiernan's writing. Passages like the following one pepper the work in such a way that you cannot help but underline them: ""Ahe she drew another deep breath, a sip of water from the bottle on the floor beside her feet, and started talking, letting the past drain like infection."" As with all her work, I highly recommend it."
1,"Gorgeous, beautiful!!","This book is beautiful and gorgeous! If you enjoy nature and taking field trips to pretty gardens, fields or just plain nature, you'll love this book! It has gushing pictures just delicately drawn. You'll fantasize this book your own personal treasure."
0,10 Dollars can be to much for a Dreamcast Game,"Graphics are nice, running around and blowing everything up is nice, walking up to an enemy, beating the daylights out of him while his partner sits there and watches you isn't very nice. Having enemy's randomly span out of walls to run out an fight you isn't nice, repetative gameplay isn't nice, running back and forth over levels looking for the proper key/switch isn't nice. All in all, this game has more not so nice features then nice ones.How did this game get a decent rating from people? Well, alot of people bought Deer Hunter as well."
0,At least their hearts were in the right place...,"I bought this album because I think John Rzeznik's songwriting is the best I've ever heard. I was disappointed with what I heard from these guys. The main problem with it is that they don't try anything different with the music, which is basically the point of tribute cds. But you won't hear any acoustic orchestrated version of Big Machine or punk rock version of Iris on here. All you get is a 3rd-rate attempt by these guys to reproduce some of the Goo's hits. I agree with the other people that I could for a fact do a better job with a tribute cd, as I've played a number of Goo Goo Dolls songs for crowds and actually get a good response...unlike this cd. The only reason I give this 2 stars is that they cited a pizza place and beer in their thank yous."
1,"inspiring,easy read",This is an excellent book to help one to enhance their time spent in the secret place with the Lord. The format allows the reader to read a short chapter and then put the book down and just soak in the truths that were written. The reader benefits from each chapter and can make daily progress in their communion with the Lord. It is a must read for every serious believer.
1,"Honest, Helpful Advice for a Copywriting Business","This is a very well written, entertaining, informative, and helpful account of what it takes to start a freelance copywriting business. Everything from suggestions on how to write different types of marketing copy to advice about how to manage money and run the business is included. This is probably the best single volume on the subject."
0,What Happened Gonzo?,"I was drawn to this book after having read ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail of '72,"" expecting to find a similar tale of '92. Alas, I was sadly disappointed. If ever there was a candidate to take aim at, it was Bill Clinton but for some mystical reason, Thompson let him drift out of his sight. Strange, since Thompson let no one escape his unmerciful eye in '72."
0,"Well, 1 out of 10 ain't bad!","There is really no reason to purchase this CD other than the fantastic Beck cover of David Bowie's Diamond Dogs. Otherwise, look elsewhere... listening to Nicole Kidman sing is like dragging your finger nails across a blackboard.Cheerio... it's your money!"
1,All Night Runner,"As an ultra runner myself I know Dean personally anmd have met him a few times.Having run myself for 19 eyears on every continent myself I certainly can nrelate to his stories.I am not i9nterested in finishinmg times but rather enjoy the experience being in nature.Dean, I think is opver doing iot a little andn maybe not too many people can relate to what he does on teh same level.However I think the book was well wtritten also the appeal and audience may have been somewaht limited.It espouses several good human qualities such as detemination, disciplene and endurance, all attribute sthat will benefit anybody throughout life.All in all, I think this is an excellent book, well written and certainly entertaining to read even if you are not a runner."
0,poor quality,"great initially but after 10 minutes of use and 2 bags of leaves the hose is like a sieve, ruptured at 7 different places. wondering whether to return it or just duct tape it. a longer hose would be more helpful too. great idea otherwise."
0,no recipes,"I was hoping for some recipes and all it had was talking about the diet, which I have read about elsewhere. NO Recipes! Would like to return it."
0,It's junk don't buy it,"It's hard to cock, it's hard to load, it's hard to shoot, and then it doesn't even have power to penetrate cardboard. I wanted to give it to my wife, so she could chase rabbits, and stray cats out of her garden, but the effort to squeeze this trigger makes my hand shake too much to hit anything, I doubt if she could even squeeze a shot off. It looks real eneugh in a dim setting to possibly chase away an intruder. Though pointing a fake gun at someone is probably the best way to get your self shot, so I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Great series - great book.,"I haven't disliked one of the books in the whole Black Dagger Brotherhood. The focus on the different characters per book is great, good adult materials, graphic, and an enjoyable read overall."
1,Under rated master,"You owe it to yourself to hear this man. Wilen had a style that wasn't like anyone else. On this album he exhibits a cool smokey tone and plays these tunes straight ahead. For example, on Mack the Knife, there is no attitude of fake hipness to get in the way of the melody. It dosen't sound like cliched versions of a 50's hipster or someone trying too hard to make something new out of it. My own complaint is that much of the album is played in the same style. If you are spending a quiet evening at home, this is a great disk."
1,Great Talent,"WHOA PEOPLE!! This is not an I-Hate-Krystal website. And what does her looks have to do with her talent? You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves dissing a young gifted, talented, hard working Christian woman. Like everyone else, she is trying to make her dreams come true, and use her gift. My GOD!No, the album is NOT perfect. What is? It may have been overproduced. Give the BSB and Krystal a break. This is her first time recording an album with a label, and this the first time BSB has OWNED a label. This was a test drive for all of them. It was a good first album. It's main focus was just to get the point across that the girl is talented. It's the SECOND album you should all be looking at. They will all improve in good time. You all just have to be willing to be patient.She WILL make it."
1,Enjoyed it!,Everything I expected it would be! I wanted this because I really wanted to hear 'Climbing Up The Mountain' again. The entire CD is a blessing to the soul.
0,Sucked!,"There's not to much else to say about this movie other than it really sucked. The 3D wasn't all that great and the CGI piranha looked horrible. The acting wasn't all that great either. Good I hope Piranha 3DD has a little more to offer, but by the looks of the trailer I strongly doubt it."
1,A Christmas Classic!,"This is surely one of the best classical Christmas recordings available. Don't buy the older version, as the quality of this recording is excellent. This is one of those ""Every Christmas - Can't have Christmas without"" recordings."
0,Incredibly Boring & Unoriginal,"I love Ralph Fiennes but this film is truly bad. That pharmaceutical companies test and dump obsolete technologies onto the Third World is old news. But when Ralph's wife starts asking questions, it gets her murdered! Please. As if any multi-billion dollar industry would be so concerned about the rantings of a pregnant ding-bat.The real problem, is that you don't care about the wife who is found murdered. She is an unlikeable character; I couldn't wait for her to exit the movie. She is obnoxious, secretive, and you just don't fully trust her. What ruined it for me, is that Ralph Fienne's character gives up his life to find a wife who was a virtual stranger to him; he didn't even know her. Their relationship was barely established, there was no sense that theyhad any kind of emotional connection. Enough said. Boring, boring, boring. And finally, I'm so sick of the SHAKY CAMERA in films these days. It makes you sea-sick."
0,A Poor Piece of Trailor Park Rap,And you thought that Vanilla Ice was a bad rapper just wait till you here the Marshall Mathers LP. .... This guy raps about jibberish. One minute he's talking about his exwife and the next minute he's talkin about NSYNC or NSTYNC as he calls it. Thats the only thing I agree with on this album :) Oh man don't purchase this you are wasting money. ... Remember White Guys can't Rap!
1,Touching,Wally Lamb is an incredible writer. I could not believe a man could write this girl so well. It is a wonderful story of flawed human beings and it is hard to put down. Very enjoyable.
0,Not a central system,The large box pictured must be placed on the door. The 3 other sensors operate independently with no central program box.
1,"Relax and enjoy this quirky, special movie","If you keep looking for Divine in every new John Waters film you will surely be disappointed. Divine is gone and cannot be replaced, so why not just relax and enjoy this special little film, with all of it's quirky Baltimore characters and its mild ""poking fun at"" art and intellectuals. I highly recommend this film. If you miss having something to feel intellectually superior about, you can always see ""The Blair Witch Project"". If you want to have some fun, see ""Pecker"""
1,Excellent Compilation,I was looking for a compliation of this exact geographic area and this CD hits the spot. Excellent combination - well done!
0,"OK book, but does not worth buying","I bought this book to try and improve my personal statement for residency application. This book is straightforward, but it is too simple. You will not find any majic formulas or great examples. The examples that are there - are VERY VERY classic and long unappreciated by the RD's.I am sorry to tell this to the author but the usual ""I saw a physician saving little boy's life"" or ""I delivered clafs when I was 5 and that is why i want to become a OB/GYN"" are no longer working succesfully to get interview. If you need examples - surf the web and then WRITE YOUR OWN PS.ON a separate note: I thing I did agree with the author is that the use of the online automated services is probable not the best option to go thru, so the answer is (I think) better write your ow - even if it is not perfect - you can FEEL that the person wrote it, that it is not unpersonal"" statement."
0,oh god...,"Are you kidding me? This movie is pathetic. I wish i could give it less than one star, but amazon is being generous. I've tried to watch this movie 3 times, never getting through the movie, always turning it off in disgust."
1,simply magnificent,"Mistrustful is more than a coming of age novel and more than a novel about a young man coming to terms with his sexuality. Mistrustful takes us on a ride for Davis Virginia's first year at Clark Atlanta University. Mr. Jackson's subtle approach to character development leaves you knowing his characters intimately, as if they are ""infused"" in your psyche. He uses dialogue in a unique way to convey information and insights. I found this book to be perfectly enjoyable. It's a fun romp around the life of a young man who's hormones are out of control as well as a blend of life lessons and insights people of all ages can understand and relate to."
1,This series has it all !!,The Lambert Series has something for anyone that is into wild soap operas! The characters are diverse and the storyline kept me glued to my seat until after I had finished the entire 4-bk series. I hope Ms. Murray has another series in mind (real soon) for us (her die-hard Lambert fans!)
1,SHARP!!,THIS IS BY FAR THE SHARPEST KNIFE OUT OF THE BOX I HAVE EVER USED!! LOVE IT AND YOU WILL ALSO!!
0,Worked great for 4 months,"This microwave is a piece of JUNK. It is now the largest paperweight we have in our home. I guess we could leave it plugged in for the clock. It lasted 4 months,a month too long to return to the store. My husband says he plans to install a large eye-bolt and it would make a great boat anchor."
1,Absolutely excellent.,"Excellent instruction. Good for all levels - more advanced can drill, review. Beginners - it's the best of what I've tried so far. EXCELLENT explanation of ""por"" vs. ""para""."
0,One of the worst movies ever made,"While this movie has excellent special effects, it has an incomprehensible plot, robots which for some reason have cultural accents, and some of the worst dialogue I've seen in years. Why was this movie around two and a half hours long??? I seriously cannot fathom why so many people like this movie (and the first one for that matter). Michael Bay made a classic action film in 1996 (The Rock) but he has gone way too far in making over-the-top, mindless, action summer blockbusters. Please do not make a third one."
0,Dissapointing,"I bought Breath of Fire 1 and I admit, it was one of the best experiences ever. It was fresh and innovative. The graphics could have been better, but it was still an epic adventure you can't miss. But little did I know, the second installment, I guessed would be the best game ever but I was mistaken, the graphics are worse and are reinforced by a terrible storyline not even relevant to the first. In fact the cinematics are poor and the battle sequences have done nothing but become more blurry and the special effects have dropped. What's happening? Never buy this game. honestly!"
0,"Poor flyer, get a JAWZ instead","I got one of these for my sister's dog. He hasn't destroyed it, but it simply does not fly nearly as well as the JAWZ disc I got for my two dogs. The Kong disc is basically a tank of a disc. My dogs will occasionally play tug of war with the JAWZ on the retrieval and it stands up to the abuse AND is a better flyer than the Kong."
0,Not Happy with Accuracy,"I now have 2 of these thermometers, thanks to a replacement sent to me by Chaney because the first one wasn't accurate, but neather is the replacement. I live within 3 miles of an offical weather regestered station in Pecan Grove Texas called lonestarweather.com. These thermometers are never close to the temp recorded at the weather station. I placed them on a double pane sliding patio door facing north, under a covered patio where the sun never shines so I could get an accurate reading. Today, this morning, they are 5 deg. higher than the weather station, They look nice but can't rely on them for accuracy.Update;After 10 months the batteries are dead, so I went to Walmart for new batteries only to find out the battery cost almost the price of the thermometer. Back to the spring or liquid design."
1,The best satire of the American public is found here,"Nothing is too sacred for it to be lampooned in Mad magazine, to the benefit of us all. Among others, in this book there are sections on:*) If corporations ran summer camps.*) If they had summer replacements in everyday life.*) If the U. S. government bought like the U. S. public buys.*) The lighter side of winter.*) Labor Day cards from management to labor.*) Mad's football roundup for little-known schools and colleges.There is no one better at writing satire of the American public than the staff writers of Mad. The best satire has a bite to it and that found in this book really bites. I laughed out loud at many of the jokes and I am sure you will as well."
1,Top-notch fiction!,"I literally could not put this book down! Combining leading edge scientific research with white-knuckle drama, Threshold is a must read for thriller fans"
1,"Great product, great price","Honestly...my review is very similar to what others are saying. These bottles are easy to hold and easy to clean because it does break down into pieces. I think that the price is great for what the product is, and I like the color variety. I agree that the bottles do not leak as long as you screw them together correctly. As for how much the bottles hold true to their claim? Not sure! First baby! So my reference of more or less is undetermined! So far so good though!"
1,probiotics,These work great for me. I have UC and they make it very manageable. I can't really say why they are effective but they are just one a day in the AM
1,Very good book---especially if you know Pittsburgh,"This is a wonderful novel about youth, occupation, andparental relations. And if you think you've got problems,the narrator has to deal with a father in the mob,a girlfriend and a boyfriend, and a weird circle offriends. (It's even better if you've lived in the Oaklandarea of Pittsburgh and can recognize the local landmarks.)Definitely a good piece of literature---don't be fooled bythe title."
0,Sadly not a major update,"The Shorter OED is too Britocentric and does not cover North American English well. If you live in the US or Canada, the Merriam Webster is a much better work.Unlike the OED, specific dates are not given and only date ranges such as E17 (for early 17th century) are provided.The quotations are given haphazardly for some senses but not others and many words have no quotations at all. You might be better off getting the whole OED if you're interested in the history of words.If you already have the fourth or fifth edition, do not bother buying this sixth edition as sadly little has changed. Apparently, Oxford University Press is more interested in churning out editions in order to pad its bottom line but won't make the effort to truly update the dictionary."
1,"I would give it five, but...","I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement."
0,Worst Written Book Ever,"After watching the movie with my coworker, I decided that the movie was just okay. She explained to me that the book was better (Why does everyone say that about every movie?). I borrowed the book from another coworker and started reading. After struggling to read the first chapter, I almost quit reading it. Knowing what was going to happen, I thought it was going to get more interesting when Edward actually started talking to Bella. I struggled to read the book until the scene with the truck. After this was boringly described I just returned the book to my coworker without finishing it. The movie was better than the book.If the only thing you read is a stop sign then this is a great book for you. For some reason people actually like it. To be on the NYT Bestselling list is an insult to every other book on this list. To put is simply this book was poorly written. You cannot picture the story unfolding even with the movie to refer back to. No descriptive narrative at all."
1,"It's a good, but short book.","This Choy Li Fut book is a pretty good introductory book on the Choy Li Fut system. I've heard of lots of tales about the systems origins, but this has it. Well, don't be fooled by the cover where it says step-by-step guide to the fighting secrets of Southern China's....There's only 2 forms: Five Wheel Stance and Fist. In some points, I'd have to agree with the first comment on this page. It doesn't even describe the movement of the forms. The pictures aren't pretty clear. At least it's more genuine than the Choy Lay Fut book by Lee Koon Hung."
1,"I, The Jury",Very enjoyable film about Private Detective Mike Hammer (Amande Assante) and his investigation into the death of a friend which leads to Run-ins with the Mob and CIA. Fast paced and great funny dialogue from Assante who is very good in this film. Great supporting cast and great chemisty between Assante and Laurene Landon. Solid action scenes and great story. I won't give any more away. Definitely worth a rental or purchase from Amazon Instant. Glad that this was finally available to buy in HD instead of just rental only as this film is not yet available on Blu Ray or DVD. Worth the $11.99 purchase.
1,Smooth as silk,"I grew up listening to Dean, Tony, Perry, and of course, Frank. Dean always had a special place in our family's heart, and this collection is a perfect reminder of how polished and lush Dean Martin's voice was. The recording is fun and nostalgic, and I am thrilled to have all my favorite Dean Martin songs on one excellent CD. I recommend it to Baby Boomers everywhere."
1,hello exaggeratters!!!!,WOW ! talk about not acctually reading the book. Maybe some of the other reviewers shoud take a chill pill and try reading it again. They never say DON'T feed your baby or just let it cry. It gives very helpful information on making sure your little gift gets a full feeding. The only time they talk about anything that might not be common sense to most is to feed-wake-sleep schedule your little one instead of feed-sleep-wake. I would expect most people to understand it is not nessecery to run to your baby with your breast out at the drop of a hat! Tip: if a baby cries it is okay. Remembering that anything in excess is bad. This book has been recommended to me by some of my most stable clients and I have recommended it to others I know. The four stars is because this is only a guide book.
1,Excellent brace!,"Worked well traveling overseas, especially the flight over and back when my injured foot swelled. Couldn't recommend a better product!"
1,Great book,Gives a good clue to dating. Helped me a lot no more pity party and I am not wasting the pretty
1,This product WORKS!!!,"Misleading Header on Amazon indicates price is for '11 Pack' - NOT TRUE! The product itself is fabulous and I have ordered it three times. We take it twice a day, and it works. Grateful this seller carries it, but Amazon should fix the header."
1,The book that i read was a very interesting book.,Charlie Brown books are a one of a kind story books that every person I know can't stop reading them. I check them out from my local school library every chance that I get.
1,For ease in older folk,"Bought specifically for my golf bag...makes it easy to slip on my golf shoes without having to bend over and contort my old body...! The bent portion on the top keeps it from slipping down into the golf bag...! As usual, arrived promptly by Amazon!"
0,Could not play it,I received the movie; and it would not play in my blu-ray player. A message appeared saying it would not play in this region. I had no idea what this meant. I only know the movie would not play. I returned it on 11/23/12; and as of today have heard nothing back. I'm now reluctant to purchase any more blu-ray movies from Amazon. I hope this matter will ultimately be resolved.
1,A classic of literature,"This story of an outsider viewing contemporary American society is a classic. Finding those special good people if we look. It will not go out of style.It tells a simple story covering up a solid theme. Adventure, compassion, characterization.Don't forget to read it to your kids!"
1,RN caduceus charm,This was a gift for a special new RN. I have one and she now is enjoying hers. The service was excellent and prompt and packaged nicely.
1,hardcore fans may disagree...,But I think the Crossing were one hit wonders. This cd is well worth the price but there aren't a lot of really memorable tracks.
0,Useless - Will NOT stay mounted on sink,"I bought this water filter and was thrilled with it at first - it was easy to mount to my kitchen faucet and it filtered the water well - great taste and everything.HOWEVER, within 2 weeks it started popping off the faucet every time the water was turned on. I used their mounting hardware that they included and it just doesn't work for long - the filter will not stay attached to the piece that screws into the faucet.So, I got 2 weeks use out of this and that's it. While this is an inexpensive filter compared to some others, only getting two weeks of use out of it makes it a VERY EXPENSIVE and frustrating filter.The whole thing is very poorly designed, as you can see from the other reviews.Save yourself some heartache and buy a different filter."
1,"THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN, PERIOD... END OF STORY","The Last GameAll I want to say:1) I hate sports2) I hate football3) I love movies4) I was forced to watch it... and think it is better than SPELLBOUND, or any MICHAEL MOORE film,or even HOOP DREAMS, which is the only other sports film I respect fully.I went to a great school, and majored in film history for criticism work.I know great docs- this is the best one I have ever seen- they were VERY lucky and very TALENTEDto focus on family and flaws--- not just football.Asha"
1,Wonderful Device,I purchased the Hitachi Magic Wand as a Christmas present for my sweetheart. It's everything you read about here! A great massage especially for sexual stimulation! We both are impressed with the results!
0,"Poor packaging, so wasteful","Great cream, love it, and would give 5 stars, but halfway through, it gets difficult to push out the product. It's true of all their products in this hard plastic tube--PLEASE change the packaging material to a softer one!"
0,Some Bad Writing.,"I am a history teacher, and I got this as a gift. It is unspeakably bad. As a previous reviewer mentioned, it is rife with grammatical errors and is nearly unreadable. I feel bad trashing someone's work, but really - don't waste your time. A student who wrote like this would be lucky to earn a ""C""."
0,total waste of time!!!,Don't bother with this sucky movie!!!Story line was awful! To many different themes going on.
1,good solid album,If you like rainbow then you should like this one. Good production good songs great guitar playing. Not the best rainbow album but worth buying.
1,A good book at a good time,A must read for everyone with faith. God's Policits is a good book at a good time.
0,paint by numbers,"I just couldn't take it. I don't demand revelatory originality in my escape reading, but this was such an obvious rip-off of LOTR, I couldn't stomach it. Every single element was a blatant substitution for something from Tolkein, and so obvious it was distracting!Instead, I foundThe Belgariad, Vol. 1 (Books 1-3): Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambitand got my fantasy fun. Sure, it's archetypal to the point of cliche, but with its own internal logic and some satisfying psychological insights, so I was able to enjoy it on its own terms, not as a thinly veiled copy of something better."
0,The true about DVD copying,There are many free utilites that you can use to copy DVDs to CD on the Internet. This software has just use what has been around for a couple of years and put it in a package and resell it. I bet you can get better quality and options if you download these utilties yourself.
0,Waste of money,"Do not waste your money on this book. I was able ro read a friend's copy (which he paid $3 at a garage sale). This book was obviously done as a self-promotional tool.Instead of buying this book, Google search the items in the table of contents which are provided for you by Amazon. You will gain a lot more knowledge than what is in this rag. What really gets me, is that he is charging a large amount of money for a book that has readily available information on the Internet.If you want to waste $27, buy this book. Otherwise, do some basic research on the Internet and gain more knowledge than this book or its author has to offer."
0,Rather Dull Book,"Disappointing. In my opinion the title is misleading, it's more compendium of objects you might use on your altar than a ""complete guide."" Illustrations are only line drawings, paper is very cheap. I don't get the sense of quality that the subject deserves. Some helpful information."
1,The best clawhammer instruction video I've seen,"The basic clawhammer strum takes time to develop. (Ive been at it for a year, and it's starting to sound pretty ripping now!). This video is great, goes through everything slow, has good songs, which progress from easiest (basic strum) to hammer ons and pull offs, then to doubble thumb, then finally to drop thum, which he says takes you through beginner to intermediate. I think drop thumb is pretty tricky, so I might put it beginner to advanced. Like I said, I've been at it for a year, and I'm not through to the end of the 2nd DVD yet, and can't drop thumb that well. I would also recommend checking out the ""daily frail"" from patrick on youtube.com, as he is a great teacher too. Watch out though, clawhammer is more additictive than crack, and could lead to broken relationships with those around you!"
1,"How ""Hard Rock"" would be carried to the next Century","Listening to this latest CD of Gov't Mule, I can't help wonder all these new venue Warren, Allen and Matt have made to approach an epic style of music that started it all. Good heavy guitar and solid backup rythym. Hard rock, spice with blues and jazz manuevers. Contemporary style on an age old music we call ""rock"" which I would say, nobody knows how to play anymore. Noting that this would be norm on how to do this music and bring it all the way to the next century, where the Mule would be leading this task. After seeing Gov't Mule live in Seattle, I decided right there and then that this would be my favorite band from that time on. Talent and the essence of the music is what really counts in the end, too sad you seldom find it nowadays, except for a few exception, like the Mule."
1,Wow....,"I played this at my friends house and was immediatly hooked. I went out to target and got it the next day. It was soo awaesome. It was excelent how my 2 bros. could play with me on multi-play. And for any mothers or fathers who are reading this and are having second thoughts about getting this be cause it's Teen, it shouldn't be teen. It should be E ten and older. it's basically most famous cartoon characters (Bowser, Donkey Kong, Mario, Samus and alot more) meleeing eachother untill the opponent falls off the edge. Doesn't sound alot like a T game to me! ANyway, if your looking for...-alot of fun-a non (extreme) violent game-a 4 way multiplayer-a game thats fun to play after a stressful day,GET IT!!"
0,Saitek P2600 Rumble Pad PC Game Controller,I bought this together with my Half Life 2: Episode pack but unfortunately the key pad on the controller doesn't want to function on this game. So for me this is a lousy PC Game Controller and I'll not recommend this to anybody.
0,Not Happy!,"I purchased this chain saw as a gift. I received it in two days which was great. It ran for a few minutes after the initial start, then it quit immediately. I called the company and they told me it had to be calibrated for the state I live in. They gave me two places to take it too, one with a 2 week wait period the other with a 5 day wait time. Very disappointing. I have a new saw and no guarantee that it will work. The company I was directed to have the calibration done, told me they have never had to do this for new saw. I have always trusted Amazon to purchase items through but this purchase was a mistake."
0,The batteries are worthless,"I bought these and don't really use them. Only one battery keeps a charge, and that's only for 2 hours. It's cool to see the pretty blue light, but other than that these are in the back of a closet taking up space. I never play Wii but bought these thinking i would. If i played a lot i would hate these more than i hate Apple, but lucky for these, i don't. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to the store prices, look elsewhere. These are filled with failure and get charged with disappointment!"
1,Ducky Tub,"My son had one of these. I wanted one for my niece, 17 months old and afraid of the ""big"" tub. I couldn't find one locally, so ordered from here. My little tub arrived in about 4 days and my niece LOVES IT!!! No longer a fight to get her in the bath, just out."
1,Good book second time around,I recently re-read this book for a book club. Last time I had read it was probably 10 years ago. I felt it stood the test of time and I enjoyed it more this time than last probably because my knowledge about the bible was stronger this time around.
0,cool looking coffeemaker really is disapointing,"i too loved this coffee pot--- for a few months. it made great coffee, faster than most pots. it looked very cool sitting on my counter. i didn't have pot long enough to descale more than twice(the ""needs descaling"" light came on) then one morning my pot made coffee without using all the water. the next day it would not come on at all. it is true,this is a terrible waste of money, even at ""bargain price"" beware !"
0,Retained Mode is Dead,"Why write a book about D3D RM. It's dead, Microsoft dropped it. Makes this book a big pass."
0,Purchased 2,1st one started leaking from fresh water tank aftor 8 months.2nd one started leaking aftor about 9 months.They do make good coffee so i convinced myself the first pot was just a dud.Not So.
0,My Opinion of Ms. Skom,"I did not read this book, but I did take a class with the author, Edith Skom, at Northwestern University. She is an arrogant, snotty woman with little care for whether her students are learning. So in the name of all that is good and decent, do not read this book or try to purchase it-- if, that is, there are any copies of her retarded books still extant."
0,More pop? No thanks...,"Obsession from Eighteen Visions was probably one of my top CD's I owned, so I decided to give this CD a shot obviously - I was counting the days until its release.After doing a run through on the CD, I was very disappointed. They seem to have regressed in evolutionary sound, Obsession was much more raw, harder and interesting to listen to compared to this. You can tell that they had major record label influence to turn out songs they could play on the radio.I can honestly say I only like two songs on the entire CD, I hate their single Victim - it's not even that good of a song to begin with!The only songs I can say are worth listening to are Black And Bruised, and The Sweetest Memory. Although even the best of the best on this CD are still sub par compared to anything on Obsession.It saddens me when bands lose their sound, because that's what happened with Eighteen Visions."
0,Broke in a month or two,"Nice little cooker, but the button broke in about 2 months. I took it apart to try to fix it and the button is held on by two tiny screws into little plastic holders that were broken and ruined. I'm not hamfisted, so not a very strong setup for the only moving button on the thing. Oh well, that's why it's $15. Makes me mad though because now it's in the landfill and I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks (or more like 25 cents) so it would last longer."
1,Dark forces meet Film Noir,"I am a fan of this sort of thing but found myself being bored of the Soap Opera which Buffy became and was really happy with the dark, film noir aspects of this series.Angel is a dark, batman like figure who would prefer to do his part and return to the shadows of his home to brood and revell in his lost love and cursed life (Not a bad concept, but old fast), so you introduce the quirky ex Buffy character Cordellia (played by the extremely hot Charisma Carpenter) and the likeable Irish sidekick Doyle and you have comic relief and a way to get into the plot through the fact that Doyle recieves visions of people in need of help.I really enjoyed this series which was moving in parts and even had some chilling moments (rare these days).I feel the show went down hill after this series, but this series holds true to a great concept (that darkness is just under everyday life).It's up there with the greats such as, Night Stalker and the early Xfiles series.Check this out."
1,This book haunts me 6 months after reading it!,"This is the most profound book I have read in 2007. I think about it often and my book group seems to revisit it every month even though we read it 6 months ago. This is a raw story of healing and torment, not self indulgent or too self absorbed like many other acclaimed memoirs. I loved it and could not put it down"
1,My 2 and 4 year old LOVE this!,"My 2 year old is obsessed with the story of The Three Little Pigs. I got him this movie as a B'day present and he and my 4 year old love watching it. The several short cartoons hold my boys' attention much better than one full length movie. None of the content is scary and aside from the Big Bad Wolf saying that one of the pigs looks stupid, there aren't any words that are unsuitable for young kids."
1,Ella enchanted was much better but this was a great story.,"It was too predectable, I could easly figure out what was comming next. It was a very odd story though and I like that in a book."
1,A True Talent In The Making,"After winning American Idol in 2004, it became apparent that Fantasia was bound for success. This single cd, though only three tracks in length, is just a glimmer of the true talent that is to come from Fantasia.The powerful, moving ""I Believe"", the funky ""Chainb of FoolS"", and the light, calm ""Summertime"" all showcase a slwaless star who is bound for much success and greatness in her years to come."
0,AT LAST!!!,"I have always loved Cyndi Laupers voice and knew it was powerful. However, I was so saddened when I purchased this album. I felt that the only good song on this album was AT LAST!!! It was done so well, yet the other songs were remakes of classics in such a strange unrecognizable way. I found this album horrible, its the music that follows the songs and the restructuring of the classic songs that ruined it for me. I think Cyndi could have performed these songs with classic melody and displayed her voice more. SHe is so gorgeous and talented and has so much power behind her voice. I will say that the song AT LAST rocks!!! I also thought Making Whoopi was kind of cute. I just felt so let down by the rest of this album."
1,Great,"Works well with my 4G sansa clip. USB connector is a little loose, but does not seem to be a problem."
0,The War Is Lost,"It's cinematic gentrification. Erasing history. 'Nuff said.Cleaning up the edges is one thing but adding or removing anything makes it a whole new movie.There are plenty of directors and producers who have always said that as soon as a movie is made and released, it is no longer theirs but the audiences. These were OUR movies not his to do with as he pleased."
1,"What was unclear before, is now clear.","I've been administering Checkpoints for about a year now. Like many admins I learned how to do it in a trial by fire. Well all I can say is I wish I had this book a year ago. The author explains everything clearly and I finally understand certain things that have been bedeviling me for a year now. Bravo Phoneboy. If you administer CheckPoint firewalls you gotta buy this book. It is indeed ""essential"". Excellant job!!!!!"
1,Great Studying Material,"The ACSM certification review is amazing to refresh your memory (or learn how the ACSM test is based) to build you up for your big test.Lots of info to absorb,and for me its more of a reminder for what i learned over the past year (graduated fitness technician woot!).But definately reccomend it.-J.Benavidez,Cpt"
0,The only dog toy I've ever returned,"I was really disappointed in this toy. I bought it to keep my dog busy. She is a chewer, but she has never bothered to chew up rope toys before, so I thought this would be a good fit. Unfortunately, she DID chew up the rope--maybe because there were treats on the other end of it inside the bottle. This wouldn't be a problem if the rope was replaceable. It isn't."
0,"Ambitious, but...","On the plus side, this is ambitious, creative, original writing.On the negative side, the narrative is often incoherent, and sometimes so emotionally shattering that one longs for it to end. It is also marred by a persistent ""Aren't I clever?"" whispering around the edges of the text.Overall, it is worth reading if you have some spare time, but seriously flawed."
0,piece of crap,this is a pointless book and i hope you burn it muahahaha! i read it at my pal's home and it has no point. You are paranoid. i hope u kie.
1,Brilliant,"This book reveals the inner thoughts and feelings of those we hold close. It is thought provocing - and hits a chord with children, and adults alike - that you never really loose touch with those that mean alot to you...they are there and always will be. Thank you Claire for your insight."

0,Case Review,"I love the case and it fits my w580i perfectly; however, it is unusable because it has a magnetic clasp and sends a busy signal every time I remove the phone from the case when it is ringing."
0,Terrible,"Yeah, I know this song is almost 13 years old, but I came across it the other night for the first time in years. I was so repulsed that it moved me to officially vent. I hated it then, and I still hate it.These guys (especially Fluff Daddy) are a big part of the reason that music has gone down so much in quality. They take someone else's music and then mumble on top of it and think they are artists. Seriously, these guys talk like their mouths are filled with marbles or marshmallows. Just when you think it can't get any worse, The Notorious P.I.G. chimes in to say, ""I've got even more marshmallows in my mouth and I can still rap!"" Well, you won the round of Chubby Bunny, guys, but we all lose."
1,My first Durutti Column purchase..this one is a keeper...,"Wow. Someone Else's Party just showed up on my doorstep today. I was captured by Requiem for Mother on Radio Paradise and bought this album on a whim (I trust RP's judgement immensely)...I am VERY happy...I can tell this is going to be one that just keeps spinning and spinning. I am new to Durutti Column/Vini Reilly but can tell that I will be listening to all I can find - this music just completely defies categorization...somebody called it offbeat and trippy - which definitely apply. The guitar playing is just sublime and masterful...and unlike ANYTHING I've heard come out of a chunk of wood and some steel strings before...classical, flamenco, rock influences all around, but blended with clearly virtuoso talent. Wow. This one is special."
1,This is the one to buy...,"If you only buy one zydeco collection, this is the one to buy. Putumayo is a label that specializes in world music. All their releases have beautiful artwork and include a booklet with notes about each song. This release is a great compilation of recent and current and most of it rocks. A sampling of the more popular musicians include...Beau Jocque...Nathan & the Zydeco Cha Chas...Boozoo Chavis...Queen Ida...Clifton Chenier...Buckwheat Zydeco...and Chris Ardoin does a cover of ""Pass the Dutchie"""
1,Shel Silverstein's Falling Up will not let you down!,"Falling Up is the third collection of poems and drawings offered to us by the multi-talented Silverstien.This book will appeal to the child and inner-child alike.Regarding age, this book like: ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" and ""A Light in the Attic"", knows no boundries.In addition to being a poet, Shel Silverstien is an accomplished cartoonist, playwrite and lyricist.Mr. Silverstein played a big part in the early career of Dr. Hook, writing such hits as ""The Freaker's Ball"", ""Cover of the Rolling Stone"" and many others.The popular country classic ""One's on the Way"" by Loretta Lynn was penned by Shel Silverstein.The Irish Rover's signature song ""The Unicorn"" was also written by Silverstein and can be found in ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"".If the author is Shel Silverstein, you can't miss, as the copy within is sure to be a hit!"
0,Not helpful,"Didn't notice any results. Maybe I didn't use it long enough, but I didn't notice any benefit at all. Would not recommend."
1,A Great Investment,I purchased the 305 after almost 6 months of review and feedback from friends. It has been the best investment I've made in my training. I'm still learning all of the features but the immediate ones I needed were perfect right out of the box.
1,nok hockey,"Ordered it as a Christmas gift and thought I'd get it after the holiday, but it got there 3 days after I ordered it. I was happy with the quick delivery, and everything was in tact."
0,No luck with the camera and the company,I received this camera as a Christmas gift. The batteries actually pop out of the camera without warning. The driver software is defective. I have gotten the software to work one time. I contacted the company about the problems with the camera and software. I have yet to get a reply or any assitance of any kind. My advice is to let that camera decorate the shelf on the shop where they sell them.
1,Sweet!!!!!!,This blade is really sweet!!! But it doesn't seem to win much unless you use the special rule (Launch 5 seconds after opponent.). Although a few times when I was fighting driger-s I crushed him out of da stadium. Get this blade even though it isn't good at endurance or attack I like it. Dranzer-s Seems to win more then this but I like this better.LET IT RIP!
0,Thank goodness I didn't buy this one!,"Muddled. Incomprehensible. Just plain bad. I'm not sure what movie everyone else watched, but the Pirates 3 movie I watched was horrible! And plus, it was just another sequel setup. That's enough, Disney."
0,Worst test prep book I have ever used.,"As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time."
1,A classic,"Anywhere But Here, personally, is my favorite movie of all time. Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon were the perfect cast. The movie shows Ann (Portman) just trying to get by on life. This movie moves to be quite deep and one that is full of emotion because of its characters that so many people can relate to. A classic with no doubt and one of the most underated films ever! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Full of smiles and heavy-up on charm,"For anyone who grew up in a small town, this book is wonderfully nostalgic. It is absolutely pure downeast flavor. Beautifully believable characters and wonderfully depicted Maine coastal scenes. This is a charming read!"
0,Nice Attempt,"Em's mom is a burned out beeotch anyway. ID-X, who the hell are these clowns anyway? Eminem crushes these guys in every aspect of the hip hop world. This is a huge miss on her part and these horrible rappers. They are already dead"
0,THE WORST BOOK EVER MADE EVER,I wouldn't recommend this book to my WORST enemy it was SO BORING and without any action at ALL!!!!!!!!!!!! The characters were SO unrealistic the author could have made them fall on a bed of nails at 200 MPH from a 2000 story building and they would have lived.REVIEW By Why Read Such A Boring BookP.S. I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK IN 5TH GRADE BY MY TEACHER MR.EJ
0,Forget it!,"Bought this owl locally to try to keep the various birds out of my vegetable garden. No luck at all with that! I even tried moving it to different places in the garden, but the doves and smaller birds just ignore it. My daughter brought up a good point. Owls are nocturnal and birds are day creatures so why should they be afraid of owls??"
1,The Babys' best efforts,Both of these are GREAT albums. The Babys were so overlooked and it is great to hear their music on CD. My favorite band EVER!
1,The Twisted Badge,"Entertaining and informative. Anyone concerned with the future direction and intended targets of the ""War on Drugs"" would do well to study the chapter entitled ""Operation Desert Snow"" for it's revealing look at the federally funded drug interdiction programs perpetrated on our interstate highways."
1,Robust and Intense,"Raajeswari Padmanabhan, whether the pace is fast or slow, plays the veena with an intense attack and robust vigor that distinguishes her from most of her fellow virtuosi on this distinctive South Indian instrument. This approach may lack some subtlety but it makes for vibrations of energy that involve the listener's entire body. You don't just hear it, you experience it.Equally invigorating is the unnamed mridangam drummer, who may or may not be her daughter. My suspicion is that the drummer is uncredited, and the daughter is playing a backup veena, quite common in this sort of music. Voyager, noted for its scanty notes, is no help in solving this mystery. At least they do name the principal artist, which most of the time they don't."
1,GSW-33 Fixed My Whole House Fan,"This switch was just what I needed to fix my two-speed whole house fan. The old switch operated roughly ever since it was new, and finally jammed after many years of use. This one operates much more smoothly. I didn't have to enlarge the mounting hole at all. This switch comes with a nylon pull-cord extension, which I replaced withe chain extension from the old switch."
1,clairecce...,oh so scary! Youll never fix fava beans again without thinking about this movie! The characters are well portrayed and you will not forget it.
0,No Stars,"I can't believe that they rearranged the Insert/Home/Delete/End/PgUp/PgDn keys! Being a veteran computer user, gamer, and touch-typist, this keyboard is useless to me. Every time I go to hit one of these keys, I end up hitting the wrong one. Whose bright idea was it to change this key layout that's been working for more than 15 years??? What is Microsoft going to do next, rearrange the letter keys? Idiotic keyboard. Stay away."
1,WONDERFUL!,"I decided to give this book a try after reading all the reviews. I was so into this book, I read it in 2 days. I felt like Frankie and Clay were my best friends; I got so wrapped up in this terrible ordeal. I felt so helpless! The love Frankie and Clay had for eachother was awesome. The way the book ended left me with such a smile on my face :) I will continue to read Sharon Sala and am glad I have found such a great author!"
0,Just BAD,"This movie was so bad that I am speechless. And, what was Lee Majors thinking about when he agreed to do this movie?Terrible movie... really bad."
1,Very pleased,I was impressed with the fast service and the quality of the product. I would purchase from this seller again.
1,Great Product,Great price for this machine. Relatively easy to assemble and very easy to use. The hand attachments are great and has great suction to clean chairs sofa - using this on a rug is very easy and the trick is to go slow so you remove all the dirt. I highly recommend this product.
0,Keep shopping,"This music from an early-70s concert is great. The only reason for the low ranking is that all these tracks are available on ""Black Myth/Out in Space [LIVE],"" available in August 2005 from Amazon. The latter release gives you two CDs, not one, from two concerts, not one - and for a slightly lower price. ""End of World,"" however, gives you cool cover art by Jerome Bosch."
1,Show Boat Scenario for Orchestra: Glorious and Forgotten,"Well, nearly forgotten, and undeservedly forgotten. Does it transport me to another world because I first heard it when young and impressionable? No, there's beauty and emotional power in the music that makes listening an adventure every time, and I feel sorry for anyone not swept away by it. This is the best recording of several I've heard, my only complaint being the ""distant"" banjo. Altogether, it's an excellent performance and recording. (And by all means, avoid John Mauceri's version with its heartless cuts.)"
0,one woman's self obsessed rantings,"I bought this book thinking it was about someone's search for meaning. It turns out this woman is just really really self absorbed. I can get this kind of trash from reading the celebrity mags. My advice to her, pick yourself up and get a life; there are millions of people out there with REAL problems."
0,Tito,"I got this just for ""I Like It Like That"" because I couldn't find the Blackout Allstars single anywhere. A lot of this release, Tito sounds like he's trying to be the Latin Barry White."
0,Showering in kitchen,"This is my third Brita in last one year. First two got the problem with indicator.However, this one is most annoying of all. It is showering in my kitchen. I have read for this particular issue in many reviews but never realize it could happen like this... I have to tighten the screw almost 2-3 times in a day. It's keep on coming off. It is the same tap and Filter unit type I am using since last five years however this one is coming off and again. Screw threads seem to be broken and water is sprinkling out. Last week I put my water bottle and went in the living room to check on our toddler, when I came back the whole kitchen was in a mess...I have to order for new one now as I have spare filters from Brita."
0,Horrible,"I purchased one of these and entered a room that was 34 degrees Left the fluke 62 in there for a couple hours while I was in there. Four separate thermometers in various locations all read 36 and the flue checks the same area's at between 22 and 28. I haul produce and I I had relied on this it could possible cost me several hundred or thousand dollars in damages. 34 is cold, 28 is froze. This variance is unacceptable. When I showed the person running the warehouse he laughed at me and offered me a look in a drawer. He pulled it open and there was 5 of the same exact things. He told me they are a joke and that I wasted my money. It may be great at 500 degrees but at or near freezing it's useless."
1,amazing indi,"I watched this at a young age and loved it, and I love it even more today. It's a great story that both touches and makes you laugh. I def recomend it."
0,horrible,"I bought this tea at an Asian market here in town. the box looks the same but the tea was horrible. It doesn't look like little green balls of tea leaves, it looks almost black. No tight little balls, the leaves expanded a little bit when in the water, there are tons of stems just thrown in there. It looks like shredded little leaves and stems. The tea turned out yellowish brown. I can stand anything just about anything so this was drinkable, but the quality was terrible. I don't know if this is how the brand always comes or if there was a problem with mine."
0,"Worked fine for a few months, now nothing. no lights no power.","I am on the internet searching for a way to repair this oven, and the first link that came up was amazon, so I thought I would put my 2 cents in. We got it for a disabled friend of ours and it worked fine for awhile, but one day it just stopped. No lights, no heat, nothing. Seems to be fairly common with this oven.We selected this oven because the build quality felt solid and the design and styling was good. I would be wary of this model. The funny thing is there is really nothing to break in a toaster. I mean the moving parts (dials, trays, etc) all work fine still. The rest is solid state and should last 20 years. So much for that idea."
0,cheap and poor quality,this stopped working shortly after purchase. new battery didn't help- it works only while you push in hard on the rotating on/off switch. just poor quality control.
1,Interesting and inventive,"A simple story that brought you back to experience what life must have been first hand for those less well off. Also, made me think about how, for some including Vermeer, art was a way for them to make a living - not just a past time or secondary pursuit. Well written. Can see how hollywood grabbed it up."
0,2 hours long and 40 minutes of dialogue. Seriously.,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The plot just never comes together (apes discover monolith, man discovers monolith, computer goes crazy, man discovers bedroom on the other side of the universe). What is the monolith anyway? And just why did Hal go crazy? I give this movie three stars because Hal is a great bad guy, and I love the scene where he sings ""Daisy"". Very cool special effects, esspecially that psychaelic nebula. Other than those few points, Stanely Kubrick is a sick man. Just watch A Clockwork Orange and The Shining to find out why."
1,Medium and fine Riffler Rasp sets,"Rifflers were what I expected. Function as expected. What more could I expect? Working intricate shapes in hardwood isn't easy. Exceptionally fast delivery,"
0,This Movie was AWFUL,"I can't remember being so disappointed in a gay/lesbian movie. The DVD package was really good, and that's what attracted me to the film even though I knew nothing about it. But when I watched it, I found that I was laughing out loud - not at the film itself (which tries to be a quirky dramedy), but because it was so earthshatteringly awful. The acting was bad, the script was worse, and the direction was terrible, as was the music. The only reason I kept watching it was to see just how much worse it could get, and in that respect it didn't disappoint me. What a gross, gross movie."
0,Does not clump,"This litter does not clump. When I scoop out the urine clumps, the entire clump falls apart. My cat's litter box ends up dirty the first day I change his litter. Also, odor control is worthless since urine clumps fall apart. After a few days the litter box stinks. I will move on to another brand."
1,A Personal Voice,"What I liked most about this book was Segovia's own personal voice showing through. It is, indeed, a very subjective self-portrait that romanticizes just about everything, but that's what I like about Segovia and the music he played! The book is about his life viewed through his own eyes and I appreciated the intimacy opened up to me. There are other works out there about Segovia that are more erudite, accurate, and objective but there's a real pleasure in reading this one."
0,This book is useless,"This book is useless. I am an independent producer, and I found out the hard way that no financier wants to look at a business plan. If they are in the business they want to see a script and maybe, a budget. If they are not in the business, they want to see LLC documents. See The Biz, Schuyler M. Moore, Silman-James Press, Beverly Hills, 2002."

1,Bad buttons,"Killer shirt, dude! High quality material, outstanding graphics. The buttons are super cool, too! Thick, round and chrome with flames painted(?) on! But...the thread holding the buttons on is a weak spot. (on mine, anyway) Several of the buttons have only one thread holding them on and the others aren't much better. One button is sewed on properly (in my non-seamstress opinion). I plan on taking it somewhere to have someone re-attach the buttons, and then plan on wearing it out. Literally! In both senses!"
0,"No, one size does not fit most!",The panties are one size fits most....if you consider most women to be size 2-4. I am not that big and these were WAY small on me.
0,Discover Aruba VHS - Mark Drenth,"This is only a short video of about 30 minutes. It certainly is not a Hollywood production; probably 2 guys with a camcorder did the whole thing. It was taken in 1993, so it's already 7 years old. It starts with a commercial for ALM airlines also. Don't expect any real specific information, only a broad overview. Overpriced ..."
1,Great product!,"I don't know whether this stuff has pheromones or not, however I do love the smell and I do get complimented on it all the time. don't use too much though, I get sneezy if I do more than one pump. I've been using it for over a year now and I don't get tired of it. I didn't get swarms of girls falling at my feet like some guys seem to expect. It's $20.00! come on! worth the price"
0,Not that good!,"Lapinator with mousitizer. I had shopped a lot (I thought) before purchasing a laptop desk, but I should have shopped more! This was a waste of money!! The rubber ""holders"" for the computer won't stay glued despite several attempts with a variety of glues; the mouisitzer is too slippery or something, because to get my digital mouse to work I must put a mouse pad on top of the mouisitzer. This item is so unacceptable I should have returned it.jkeenan"
1,A Marine's View,"As a former Marine who went to boot camp at MCRD San Diego, Reed's story brings back vivid memories. The mind actually superimposes the faces of real life buddies onto the characters. Every Marine had his own Gunny Hill and can remember the trials that form the lifelong bond between Marines. The combat sequences are incredibly realistic and put the reader right in the ""fighting holes"" with Tuck and Donnie Boy. The ""casualty call"" visit to Mrs. Hebert will leave you in tears. This is a must read for every Marine."
0,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"Do not buy this book. The author, Bud Smith, counts on the GeoCities Web site as a teacher for 90% of this book. The only trouble is GeoCities has changed their web site and the examples listed in the book are no longer on the web site and you will be totally lost when the author tells you to go somewhere and when you do what you expect is not there.I felt really let down. I expected the book to teach me how to write web pages. You don't need this book at all if you follow GeoCities instructions on their web site. But you will not learn how to write your web page.If you want to throw away money, then purchase this book, but it won't work on the GeoCities Web site."
0,not worth free,These timers are horrible. They are not worth FREE ... if they gave them away you would NOT want one. They are problematic and setting them is beyond hard. Don't make the mistake of trying one.
0,Not a very good dance pad,"The madcatz dance pad is not a very good product. The buttons are small and too close together, and the design is just horrible. What was Madcatz thinking?The response on the pad is ok, about what you'd expect from 3rd party products, but there are better 3rd party products out there. The buttons don't register sometimes and you'll find that they get stuck after playing for a while.All in all, this pad isn't really worth the price and you're much better off sticking with dance pads made by Konami and RedOctane."
0,Its Murder,"Cornball musical without memorable songs. If you want nostalgia, as some of the reviews call it, listen to some old and far better Kandor and Ebb."
0,"Excellent as always, but...","Everyone who knows John Hammond's music knows that he only does covers of famous blues standards and his singing, harmonica and guitar playing are always excellent-those are known quantities, and this re-release of a 60's album is no exception. But prospective buyers should know that there is only 29 minutes of music here. So, if you're new to John's music, you should consider his Greatest Hits instead which has over 70 minutes of blues covers. But if you're a collector, you'll buy this no matter what."
0,Let me save you some money,"All of Christine Feehan's Dark series are basically the same. You have one guy who is a Carpathian which is basically a vampire but not a vampire.Then you have you have the woman who is usually a human with physic abilities or in one case another Carpathian who basically is supposedly an independent, strong woman who will not have her life ran by a man. However in the end the male always over powers the female and the female finds she can't live without him.You take an arrogant, self-centered Carpathian vampire but not a vampire male, add in a bunch of magic that can solve any problem they may have including getting the girl.Add this together with several pages dragged out sex scenes that 2 out of 3 times are in a cave and you basically have a Dark Series book."
1,A MUST READ!,"Obviously this is a good book that keeps your attention like no other. & I have to add (like all of the other reviews) that the book had a large amount of grammatical errors but It was expected because I read some of the reviews before I read the book..........On another note I loved my home girl Keisha (she's was my fav character) even though she messed up she was a good person unlike Epiphany & Shana (but that's just my opinion). Over all the book is a great read that you'll fly through. Be sure to buy Sheisty & Still Sheisty part 2 at the same time(They're like kool aid and water you can't have one without the other) lol. The book is full of drama, love, and heart break that'll have you on the edge of your seat and a surprise ending that made me shed a couple tears."
1,Life savers!,This is my lil' sisters favorite toy. She got it when she was a baby and it broke. i didn't know where to go to get her a new. they had it when no one else did and its exactly the same as when she was lil' perfect and hopefully it won't break for another 9 years.
0,the worst movie ever made,well actually I give this a -1 I mean how can anybody like this. Sure qui gon was good but JarJar was THE WORST THING TO EVER BE ON STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! If you haven't seen it he talks like this (meso stupid).Obi wan is Ok I only liked Mauls lightsaber there was no point to the pod race Aniken dosen't do anything until the next 2 movies no action to it exept when Obi wan fights Maul.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,favorite,"purchased 2 copies of this,1 for me,and 1 for a sister,all the songs are beautiful,and the price,and shipping was great,Thanks,great service"
0,"Thin and Loud, but Warm","We were pretty disappointed in this item. Somehow, we trusted the color in the title ""teal"" as opposed to the color in the picture, which is a sort of rusted copper. The actual color is basically just like it looks in the picture but it is certainly not teal! Anyway, that was my bad for not believing the pic but the real reason we don't give it a good rating is because it is VERY thin and every time it moves, it sounds like a sleeping bag ... loud! It also constantly slips off of our bed, just like a sleeping bag would. The only redeeming quality - and the reason it gets two stars instead of one - is that it is pretty warm. I wouldn't buy it again, but at the price we paid ($30-ish) I wouldn't return it either. It will be nice for guests or as an emergency backup for cold weather."
0,What a waste,This was a waste of a movie. Not even worth the time we spent watching it. Its so poor that it is not even worth the twenty words needed for this review. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Great for kids,"Super plush toy, soft and durable, have had for over 2 months and still looks brand new. Any kids who love elmo will love this!"
1,oh yeah,Great mic. I love the sound quality that thia mixc gives me. I take it to the other studio that I use
0,It Broke!,"This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff. However, after a few weeks of use it broke. It over-heated and then the off switch wouldn't work, so whenever it was plugged in, it was on! Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!"
0,Inaccuracy Kills Book,"Pardon my diatribe, but this book is the worst historical fiction ever written. Anyone even vaguely familiar with Poe's life with be appalled at the grossly negligent treatment of him as a drunk without a single moral in his being. Avi can't ever seem to hold a thought together, and relies heavily on the descriptions of Poe, appearing every other page, emptying a bottle. ""Poe"" in this book should not be confused with the real Poe. And I suggest for better reading to check out something written BY Poe."
1,Sony digital 8/hi8/std8mm Walkman,"May be the last of its type to play both analog 8 and digital 8. Have been told Sony's newer digital8 camcorders are not backward compatible! Only drawback to this item (our business now has 4 of them) is that as they age, the circuit boards start to give the wrong instructions, i.e., our oldest model will often go into record mode when hitting ""play."" Suggest you always close record tab (why did Sony reverse the record tab procedure that other tape formats use????) before hitting play and the problem will not occur. This has been a vital item for our video transfer business, but not necessarily an item the average consumer needs."
1,Great Story Line/Action!!,I didn't give it a 5 star because it was a little to bloody/gasping for me but I LOVE karate movies. The nite fight scenes added suspense which I love also. :). Just a liiiiittle too graphic when a head got chopped off. Eeek!!
1,2-1/2-Year-Old Loves It,"Our 2-1/2-year old son loves this toy. He loves bouncing around the house and quickly mastered it. It's a little small for him, but he's near the maxiumum age and he's also big for his size. The design is really cute. He loves talking to it, and keeps it near his bed at night. The construction is very durable (at least the membrane is very thick and appears nearly puncture proof)."
1,Kindgom Hearts Official Strategy Guide,Product was very good and it was in the condition they said it was in.
0,Ron Jeremy contines to grasp for mainstream acceptance,"Having been interested in the adult film business since the late 70's I was hoping for a look behind the curtain from someone who been a primary in the industry for nearly 30 years. What I found instead was Ron Jeremy explaining how he's been cut out of mainstream movies, lots of name dropping(celebrities I have known), some personal history, and not very much about the adult film industry.Jeremy seems to be a really nice guy who's been lead by his d**k for most of his life. His longevity in the industry is not that big a deal, men who can perform on cue last forever in porn, it's the women who get chewed up and spit out in a couple of years.I bought the book on a cut out rack for under 4 bucks. At that price it was worth the money. Ron Jeremy, in my opinion, missed a chance to write what could have been a really interesting goo on the porn industry."
0,Second damaged shipment from Amazon,"Logitech X-540 5.1 Speaker SystemThis is the second time that I'll be sending the X-540 speakers back. The first time, parts were clearly rattling around in the subwoofer. I suspect that the damage occured in transit as the packaging wasn't what you would call robust. The books that Amazon ships are much better protected.Anyhow, I shipped that set back and requested a replacement set which just arrived. With the same damage to the subwoofer! That indicates to me that the build quality of the subwoofer could be a lot more robust even with the sparse packaging.I'll shop for a different product, probably from a box store as Amazon haven't mastered shipping these things!"
1,What a great book!,"this book is amazingly helpful. i was a new owner of a Mexican Redknee and had NO CLUE how to handle her! she was so sweet, but i was just too afraid to handle her. then i found this book. Princess now has 2 brothers and 1 sister: Paris, Ricky and Jake. they are very sweet animals and the breeding part was helpful as i am getting prepared for my spiderlings :-D"
1,Amazing!,this bat-mobile is one of my favorites and the way it is made and how fast it came was incredible!!!!!
0,No menu!,"This DVD has no menu! As an artist and an art teacher, I purchased it with a genuine interest in enjoying by video the techniques of the Old Masters. The first section starts out with the very basics in shapes and shadows. The artist then moves on to figure drawing. If I want to review a section at a time, the only way to do it is to start at the beginning and fast forward until I hopefully arrive near where I want to be. It is also distracting to see the artist's arm come in front of the camera, plus he rambles. His drawings are well presented, but the video is poorly created."
1,A sobering documentary,Bowling for columbine is another proof of micheal moore's talent in filmaking. The film is an interesting and sobering look at gun control and the state of our society. Moore manages to provoke alot of thought throughout the film on the way the United States is as a society and how we love our guns. The film manages to be very interesting and at times funny but it does not stray away from the sobering truth of the chaotic state of gun crime in the US. The film may not be as gripping as other micheal moore films such as Farhenheit 9/11 but it certainly comes close.
1,Perfect!,"J.M. Dillard once again, in Star Trek First Contact proves why they go to her for the movie novelizations. This is the perfect accoutrement to the movie. It gives us great incite into what the characters might've been thinking. It also gives us some of the scenes that were left on the cutting room floor. Again, a great book that should definitely be read if you've enjoyed the movie!"
1,Cute book,"I liked this book. It has a cute story line and a happy ending. It is about a couple that had agreed they would not have children but one changed their mind after marriage. This change of heart was not felt by the other and resulted in a divorce. It shows how they go their different directions but still feel love for their former spouse. However, they start to move on with their lives but always doubt their decision to split up. I won't ruin the ending."
1,I really missed this show,This was just like watching it for the first time I looked forward to watching this show every weekend and now I still do watch it every weekend this is great one of the best boxed sets that I own.
0,Made in Germany? Really?,I was really suprised that these cost so much and are supposedly made in Germany. They bend incredibly easy and I had to throw out half of them when I was re uphostering a chair. Really disappointing :-(
0,Sucks,Too big not well discribed. Guess I should have read the reviews because looking back they all say the same thing.
0,Cartridge dries out quickly,"I don't use my printer a whole lot maybe a few times a month. The ink in these cartridges dries up quickly. Every time I turn my printer back on, I have to replace a cartridge that has dried up. The quality of the print is decent though."
1,Missionary Man,"Haven't watched it yet, but am a big Dolph Lundgren fan. Service was great, shipping fast, would use again..........."
1,Tune Belt review,I've used the product before purchasing it and like it very much. It is unique in that microphones fit perfectly in the pouch and the stretchy elastic belt makes for a nice snug fit for use during exercise.
1,Good dub CD,A lot of good tracks and shipper sent the item quickly. Item as advertised and I would recommend it to others.
1,"Enlightening, Fun & Important Read","It's a dense and fun work in a very interesting and important topic. It was my first book on law&economics, and I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend it especially for those who love economics--you will learn fascinating insights. The chapters on tort and criminal law were my favorites. David Friedman is a great teacher, in print or talk (if you haven't seen him speak, don't miss a chance)."
1,theres a boy in the grils bathroom,There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom This book is about a boy named Bradley. He had a sister named Claudia. At the beginning of the story Bradley is a lot of trouble in school and pretends to be more tough than he is. He kept his desk a mess with waded up papers and other junk. He did not do his homework and in class he daydreamed and played with the stuff in his desk. I think he was in the fourth grade. One day a new boy came to their fourth grade class. His name was Jeff. One day he made a mistake and went to the girls bathroom. Near the end Bradley decided he wanted to be good in school. I really like this book. I think this book would be good for teenagers. I hope that others who read this book like it. Rating five stars
0,Snooze,"I love Stephanie Laurens and have read every single book she's put out. This one, however, was a big disappointment. There didn't seem to be a plot. She wants to marry him, he wants to marry her. She wants to wait until after the Little Season. He agrees. That's it. They go to parties and he's proud of the way she handles herself, she feels she can make him a good wife and at the end, they're in love. I just saved you reading the book, aren't I helpful?But please, read all of her other books!!"
1,For the Windmills of Your Mind,"It takes a lot of hot air to produce a wind this mighty! In mockumentary style, the hot air isn't limited to those who play wind instruments. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, along with the other cast members from Best in Show, are together again in this flick. I like Best in Show a little better, but the wit in this one is funny too!"
1,VIKKI is the GREATEST!!,"I bought this CD on Amazon 4 years ago. The only album I had ever heard by Vikki Carr was ""En Espanol"" which of course was fabulous. This is the first Vikki Carr CD I had ever purchased and what a treat it was for me! Every song was sung to perfection. I was so impressed with Ms. Carr's vocal style and the passion that exudes straight from her heart for each song that I immediately became a huge fan. After 4 years now my collection of Vikki Carr's recordings have grown considerably. This was a great starter album for me. Good packaging and quick delivery."
0,Read The Club Dumas instead.,"I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it. And that's a shame, because it means the mastery exhibited in The Club Dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent"

1,Wonderful Book for everyone,"I just decided to get into painting fabric and came across this book online. Luckily my library had a copy. The read was straight forward and inspirational. Very simple and have me excited about starting my project. Although it is a great book for quilters, I learnt a lot from the techniques described and mixing colours for my abstract painting project. I think I am going to buy this book to keep on my shelf for ref. GREAT BOOK!!!"
1,as advertised,Shows reliable holding power. Withstood 11 ton vessel in 35 knot winds. Dries up rapidly when soaked. Allows minimal stretch. Recommend shafing protection around pilings.
1,I liked the kid...when's the movie coming out?,"I liked Billy, the title character of this story and rooted for him all the way through. I liked the detective (Petra) who tries to find the young boy who witnesses a brutal murder. I did not much care for the rest of the characters and the predictable story line. The red herrings didn't throw me, either.The victim was not very sympathetic and the villan was pretty obvious from the beginning, but I didn't stop reading because I liked following Billy through the mean streets of Los Angeles.I'm sure Hollywood will make this story into a movie...who will play Billy? Petra? The old Jewish man? The grandmother?To me, it would have been a much better ending if Billy had wound up with the Jewish man...they needed each other and truly understood one another.I liked this book and would recommend it with some, but not much, hesitation. I will go see the movie, too."
0,It has to be the Beatles or nothing!,"Having a movie based on just one of the fab four is completely pointless! Don't get me wrong, I like John Lennon, but it is like the case with Simon and Garfunkel, only together could they sing beautiful harmonies, seperately they should have given up. And so it is definitely true with the Beatles! All alone John Lennon sucks. But he needs more than just Paul. He needs George and Ringo, or you can just pass on this flick!You know I'm right."
1,Left me Speechless (no pun intended),"I was a little hesitant to read this book but after turning the first couple of pages I was hooked. The artwork in this book is absolutely stunning. I love the little bits of colour worked into the otherwise black and white artwork because the colour is always added at exactly the right places. The story itself is very powerful and it makes you wonder. While there is no specific time or place for this book it is very possible for it to happen in this world (okay, so maybe not the row boat accross the ocean part but have you read ""Life of Pi""?) the settings and events in this book are very realistic. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who is even romotely curious. This was my first graphic novel and it got me hooked so I figure that speaks for itself."
1,Great Information...,This book is full of great information for Seniors... It is so easy to follow... I will recommend it to all of my friends...
0,Still Not Sure About Product or Company,"I received the crackers and they were stale. I got a response from the company very quickly after posting the review of their product. They wanted to make it right, which was VERY impressive usually companies don't respond nor do they want to know how they could fix the issue. I told them that they didn't have to send me out a replacement, but their reply said THEY WOULD send out fresh crackers once they got a new shipment in. Well, I haven't heard from them and it has been a few weeks. I know that they don't intentionally sell old products - who would? But not hearing from them I really can't give a good review at this point. They are not giving me anything to work with here to offer an awesome review."
0,"This is a DVD review, not a review of the movie itself!","This DVD version (Pro-Active Entertainment) is complete garbage. The video transfer is so horrible it looks like it was taken right off a VHS tape. Also, the audio is not in Dolby Surround, but MPEG-2 (which simply means its in two speaker stereo). Avoid this version at all costs. If you want to purchase this movie, buy the version from Lionsgate/Fox which has a superior audio and video transfer. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Great for small space.,"I recieved this chair as a gift with my first child 4 years ago and now am using it with my second baby. I like this chair because we live in an apartment and I don't have room to put a high chair in the dining room, so for a family of four, this chair is great because it straps to one of the chairs. It reclines pretty far so that's good. There are some minor flaws, such as cleaning is a pain. After every feeding, I have to move the seat part and clean the food particles that get stuck in the little areas that are hard to get too, so that's a bit time consuming. Overall it's a great chair and is good if you don't have room for a full size high chair."
0,"ok, but it bunches.","Wearing this support for the first hour or so was great, but then it would ride up and bunch uncomfortably. I tried tightening and loosening it accordingly, but it didn't solve the problem."
1,Funny and Sweet,This is a movie we caught on an off channel on cable. The movie was different and endearing.I have a Columbia DVD and TV membership. I don't use it anymore because Amazon has better deals and if you order direct from Amazon the SHIPPING is FREE!!
1,"a very unique, refreshing contribution to modern rock","I heard the single ""Hello Time Bomb"" and I thought, There's a great rock song. I wanted to check out the rest of the album. Well, I did not find Time Bomb #2,#3,#4. At first I was disappointed; I had expected a hard-rocking album. Instead I was rewarded with a deep, melodic, varied album. To explain their sound I say imagine this:Take the catchy hooks and guitar-drive of Tonic or Seven Mary Three, add the emotional punch of Fuel and Oleander, and the melodies of Splender. I'd say they are most similar to Oleander, but they really have a unique sound. Check it out for something NEW in the world of modern/alternative rock. Highlights: aforementioned Time Bomb, also ""Deep Six"", ""Load Me Up"", ""Failing the Rorschach Test"", and I really like ""Jenny's Song."""
1,So many great features to list,"This phone has everything we need and more. Some of the best points about the phone are:- built-in speakerphone on each handset- room monitoring (saves on purchasing baby monitors)- distinctive ring tones- you can name each phone on the display (one for every member of the house)- lightweight with belt clip included for each handset- price versus similar expandable phone systemsWe have only had the phones a week or two, so I am sure we will learn about many of the other great features. The phones sound great, look great, and work great for our family. We highly recommend these for other families. I will agree with some of the other feedbacks and say if you don't like phones with small buttons, you will not like this phone; however, the button size is fine for our family."
0,Not a good ending...,"I enjoyed much of the book. It was a great experience to read how people experience religion, ritual. Creation of miths and mysticism's neurological definitions were great. Relations of brain higher, sophisticated regions within themselves and to lower, primitive regions were defined clearly. But the last 2 chapters assumed the existence of God and that's a big shadow on the book. Science does not deal with God. So writers clearly put their personal, subjective experiences in life to a ""scientific"" book. Great beginning, poor ending."
0,Not sturdy enough - Warranty not much value,"Out of the box, this power supply looked great. But after a few months of moderate use, the unit broke and would no longer work. I thought, well, it's under warranty. However, in order to activate the warranty, you need to send $17 shipping and handling (along with the power supply)to Accessory Power. If they find that the malfunction is covered by the warranty, then they send you a new one. If they decide that it's not, they send you the original one back and you're out $17. In the long-run (unless you are a very light user), I think it's more cost effective to go with a genuine HP unit."
1,Zippers,"After 2 weeks of use I have found that this bag works very well. However, I would recommend that Targus use higher quality zipers in the future."
0,this is junk,this gun is junk it looks real but does not fire i recived it put it to gether and tried to shoot it it did nothing but make a screeching noise so i took it apart and found that wires were cut and peices were broke. do not buy this rifle from airsplat.com
0,Arrived Damaged,This item was placed at the bottom of my doorstep in a ripped boxed that clearly should not have been delivered. Parts were wedged together from the damage.Also the image displayed is not the shade or color of the item received.I would not order this item online....
0,TRASHY,Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
1,"very good knife, handle is light",I like this knife but the handle doesn't have much weight. This isn't a big complaint but that is the thing I could fix if I could.
1,"Just as described,","This was a great find! They really added to my outdoor buffet party! They are durable, look great and, best of all, disposable! I did wash them in the dishwasher and they came out great!!"
0,"Very disappointing, avoid.","I didn't like this book at all. I loved loved loved ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" and wanted to know more about Livermore, but I don't think this book is the way to do it. I didn't get anything more out of this book than Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and it's a tenth as much enjoyable.In this genre I have just finished ""Way(s) of the Turtle"" by Curtis Faith and I found that to be an excellent read. In fact i'm already re-reading some chapters. If you haven't already, read either of those two first."
0,Boundaries,"Poet and teacher Jeff Mann shares his influences and memories in this collection of essays. Through travel to places such as Scotland and Key West, he connects the foreign to the personal and ruminates on family legacy, gay life and literature, and the trials of being a leather bear. Mann is an accomplished writer, and these essays are well written, but certain points are repeated over and over, creating tedium for the reader. And unfortunately, he doesn't elaborate much, so by the end of the book, the reader is not left with a clear picture of the whole man he has become, but rather is only briefly acquainted with the plethora of identity aspects Mann claims. Despite this, there is still much to enjoy here."
1,Great game idea!,"Bought this for my parents for Christmas. Since they have everything I thought this would be different. Unfortunately, I think they forgot I bought it for them!!!"
1,overpriced,"This yougurt is fantastic. It taste like yougurt should taste. the price on this site is outragious. It's available at supermarkets and speciality stores from $3.99 to $4.99 a container.Thanks, Gradsrer"
1,should be required reading!,"This book is a breath of fresh air. It makes math fun . This is the type of book that needs to be read a few times, but it is great. I wish i had this book in high school.Anyway this book is best for high school and some college students. I hope scott writes the sequel to this book, and includes topics like , trig,stats,cal,chem,and physics etc..."
0,Simplistic garden variety thriller,"A dissapointing entry into the Michael Crichton sweepstakes. ""Link"" is a simplistic thriller that takes a high concept idea but does very little with it besides your typical, run-of-the-mill characterizations and plot twists. This is a very light, by-the-numbers effort that takes a good concept and ruins it with lackluster writing."
1,"Good as a study aid, bad to rely on as an only source for learning.","This book isn't so bad when paired with several other study aids. The slant of the text is done from a far more technically linguistic perspective. While I can appreciate (and actually enjoyed it from that point of view), it's far less efficient than, say, using the Genki study system on your own, or the infamous Rosetta Stone program. Either of those two will probably suit you far better. This makes an excellent supplement and reinforcement to either. If you're technically minded it might also be interesting from that viewpoint, as well.In any case, I find it a useful addition to my Japanese library. It's come in handy for some nice changes in scenery while studying. You may find this as well, if you're collecting books to augment your studies."
1,I was wondering...,"just how many records or CDs has this critic Ricky Wright has sold? Just wondering, because I'm sure ""In A Mellow Mood"" sold a LOT more than his...ha ha ha....BTW, don't listen to him. It's a great CD. Do yourself a favor and pick it up...The Tempts are the Kings Of Cool!"
1,Best horror movie ive ever seen,If youre looking for a halloween movie to rent or buy then i definitely would go with halloween1. This is a great movie with plenty of violence and gore. It is interesting and exciting to watch. This movie should be every horror movie fan's favorite.
0,I should qualify the 1-star,"The demo version of the game is very good but be forewarned when buying the retail version: I and many other customers have had problems installing and/or playing this game! The Emperor website has a forum where users can share their experiences and many, including myself, have vented about our inability to run the game based on the minimum system requirements. Be warned: if you have the minimum system requirements for Emperor, that may still not be enough. I have more than adequate resources to run the game, but the intro movie is the only thing that will play, then my monitor goes blank and its lights all begin blinking. There do not appear to be any patches in development to address user concerns at this time. I am not the only user who has experienced this frustrating problem. I'm returning my copy of the game and will try something else."
0,I wish I'd gotten something else,"If I lived in the US I'd have returned this book. The games aren't that great. Furthermore, they don't cover the grammar and conversation I teach in junior high school in Japan. The illustrations are terrible - I don't claim to draw and I could do better than this. To use any of these games (they're actually more puzzles than games) I'd cover up the ugly drawings with liquid paper."
0,Pointlessly beautiful language,"Readers searching for alternatives to mainstream fiction seem willing to accept any crumbs; AVA is a case in point. Maso's language is, indeed, innovative and often quite beautiful. As is often the case with ""innovative"" fiction, however, it goes nowhere. AVA is highly self-indulgent--the writer is everywhere on the page--and this supposed meditation on death and dying seems like little more that the author's excuse to brag about her knowledge of art and literature and drop a few names."
0,Muppet show: music mayhem and crap!,"misrepresented. The sales pitch makes it seem like a dvd, with maybe a few episodes or muppet music videos. But no its a crappy music CD with lame songs that are no fun to listen to without watching them performed. I was way disapointed."
0,A different style to the Murmurs,"This CD brings the Murmurs into a very different realm from their first. Mostly gone are the acoustic guitars and harmonizing vocals. Instead you find a fuller band with a drummer and base guitar player. Many of the songs have a hint of country through them.After the near perfection of their first CD, I was disappointed by this one. I get the feelings that Murmurs weren't happy with this CD either, since it ran for only a short period of time and many of the songs are repeated or reworked for their next album. Unless you feel a need to complete your set, I'd say hold back the money from this CD and put it towards their next CD, Blender, instead."
1,Good Deal,Great buy! wish it was not so grainy though.... guess that is why they offer the HD version. The series are great and download is quick.
1,A Must Read for People Dealing with C Level Executives,"I have dialed the phone over 250,000 times in the past 25+ years. Most of those calls were trying to reach C level executives of companies across North America. This is one of the best books on sales I have ever read.Tom 2 tall Cunningham[...]"
0,Don't Fall For It!,"After going through far too many cheap toasters, I decided to take a chance and buy this ridiculously priced thing, thinking it would last. No luck. One of the heating elements on this piece of junk stopped working after about a year. Now when I toast two slices of bread, only one slice is toasted. The second slice is half-toast and half hot bread. I'll be damned if I'm going to take this in to be repaired after what I paid for it. It's going in the garbage. I really thought this thing would last for a decade or more, like the toaster my parents had when I was growing up. Don't fall for the hype of an expensive brand. This thing is no better than a $20 Wal-Mart toaster. In fact, it's probably worse."
0,Weak Weak Weak,"On the plus side, each battery worked initially in various installations. On the MINUS side, they each worked so briefly it wasn't worth the trouble installing them."
1,Good projection clock,"The first clock that was shipped to me was defective, but Amazon quickly shipped me another working one. This new one works well - Just note that the projection is not visible during the daytime or when lights are on."
0,Being liked is more important than being your unique self.,"This story doesn't teach sharing; it teaches of giving away your unique identity, conforming to fit in and be liked by those who are nothing but greedy little beggars who withhold friendship from those who don't conform to their demands. Is this the ocean or is it my high school from 20 years hence? Children are better to be told stories about liking themselves rather than stories of doing whatever it takes to be liked by others.It's doubtful the two sides will agree on this book, but I suggest that before buying this it, take a moment to read it and determine the message for yourself.A better story about sharing is Donna Jakob's My New Sandbox."
0,wanted to like it more,"I read all the reviews and I wanted it to be better, more enjoyable. I really forced myself to finish it. If I had checked it out of the library, I may have not even gotten past the first 50 pages. But I bought it since it was so critically praised and sounded like a book I would like. Sorry, I wanted to care about these people. I wanted to be shocked about what was really going on. But I just never really cared about any of the characters. I never really cared how the relationships worked out. I'd have to give it a C minus, but, hey - what do I know!"
1,Why buy this DVD,"This DVD is not really needed for people who only enjoy their angel voices. But a scarcity of this DVD is that, it recorded at a nice time that those little stars in Libera were at a perfect age, nice looking and nice voice. Although both its image quality and sound quality is not that outstanding, with the image memory of Libera, the Tom, Josh, Ben generation, it is absolutely valuable to buy it."
0,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!,"this game sucks so bad. They tried to copy a good game like Settlers of Catan, but totally screwed up, making a terrible game. And then they charge 50 bucks for it! Whats up with that?"
0,Something is missing.,"I would be interested in knowing if any other reviewers felt like this book was missing something--not giving the full picture. It just left me kind of empty. Very critical and unsympathetic of the young fathers, basically classifying them all as deadbeats, yet very empathetic and non-judgmental towards the unwed mothers. I know I am in for criticism, but sorry, but I was hoping for a much more unbiased, objective book."
0,a real let down,"We bought this for our 4 1/2 year old and he was so excited! He is very intrested in reading and writing, but unfortunatly we are on our third unit that still doesn't work. It keeps asking you to touch go, but none of the units have recognized the stylis. In fact it doesn't seem to recognize the cartridges either. I guess we will give up and just have a disappointed preschooler. Great concept, but like many reviewers say just too many bugs!"
0,Don't Buy This,"Landmines is a collection of unfinished songs and b-sides slung together by Jeff Gillespie for his new record company, from which the band gets nothing.As Ginger himself puts it ""don't buy it kids, but if you've gotta, only one of you buy it, the rest of you buy a good quality chrome cassette and copy it""This should have 0 stars 'cause it's a total ripoff!!!"
0,not for me...,"I am a soon-to-be father and I was really looking for a book that addressed the unique father-son relationship and its specific needs.To be fair, this book does spend some time addressing how little boys are generally different from little girls, and thus how the parenting approach needs to be somewhat different.However, I felt an unwieldy portion of this book was spent denigrating feminists, homosexuals, the media and single parents and people who do not fit into the white-picket-fence-suburban-perfection-ideal of America.I don't care about any of the author's views of any of those things; I just want to learn about good father-son parenting.People who share Dr Dobson's convictions will probably need to put the book down repeatedly to applaud. For people looking for substantive parental guidance, there's just too much flotsam to wade through..."
1,Effective book for discussing physical death with a child,"As a public school librarian, I would say that ""Lifetimes"" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: ""Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever."" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that ""Lifetimes"" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system."
0,yea its good but 1 season split into 2 for more cash is stupid,"its funny but i refuse to buy a season thats split into 2 just to make more money. ppl shouldn't pay for ripoff. 1 full season yea its worth buying, 60$ on both parts of 1 season umm no"
1,Pandora...finally revealed,"Anne Rice continues to tell the stories of her vampire characters in great detail. I can't wait to get started on the next one. The story of Pandora (which takes place right after `Memnoch the Devil' and before `The Vampire Armand') is an interesting one. Pandora's Roman heritage is fascinating as she deals with the ancient Marius, who has now become just as interesting as Lestat in many ways. The fledging David Talbot seeks to record Pandora's story as to how she became a vampire and her life before it. The story is fun and exciting, like most of Rice's vampire novels are, and we really get a sense of who this woman is. Pandora was not used much in the other novels and is somewhat of a mystery, until now."
1,Not too bad,"I've seen a lot of these old Japanese movies and this one was actually pretty good. Of course it's filled with nudity and sex, but there is actually a decent story here too. The main character is also very attractive. Of course this is nothing mind blowing but check it out if the descrition interests you."
0,Looks like a amature collection of below basic porn.,"The entire video has stuff that is sexual but no more than a sexual joke you might tell, and others are cartoons to watch while you're stoned and need stimulus (And I'm being generous with the word stimulus). This a waste of your money if you are all but sex therapists or animation collectors for its age and lack of creativity."
1,"Excellent, original, moving album","This is one of the best albums I own. The music is superb, the words are deep. Its a captivating and emotional album and even after listening to it for years it still stops me and captures my complete attention."
0,You can have mine!!!,"We'v had this Hoover for about 2 years and Im ready to junk it. After the first 3 or 4 cleanings, I thought the unit worked rather well, but then the problems started. First the scrubber wheels stoped spining. The brush drive uses plain steel gear pins that rusted due to the fact they are directly exposed to the fluids entering the machine! After cleaning and relubing these parts, it was working again. Then the leaking started. I replaced the rubber O-ring seals and it still leaked. I called Hoover and they mailed me a new water bucket and bucket base that had been slightly redesigned, It only driped slightly at first and now with about 4 uses, it litteraly has water running out of it!!!! This is without a dout, the worst possible design for fluid transmission in and out of a machine. Other than that, it cleans great!"
0,Uncommunicative singing,"The singing one this recording is uncommunicative. It seems that the singer, Russell Watson, has not bothered to understand the words and the setting of each song. Or else he wouldn't have sung each and every one of them with the same kind of voice and the same kind of feeling. Such evidence does point to the fact that Russell Watson is not a gifted song interpreter.As far as technical matters are concerned, I see that some others have already listed out the defects in a very convincing manner. I don't think I can do better. But I hope Russell Watson can find some time to brush up his singing skills and, above all, try to sing with more feeling and with a heart. That, instead of those exaggerated hypes, will serve him and music better, supposing that he indeed is a singer who cares about music."

1,Boblbee Megalopolis Aero 2006,"Got it for my brother's bday because he loved the Boblbee packpack I got him before. But this was the latest style and he uses it for everything, riding his motorcycle and bumming round town. Delivery was faster than they said it would be and everything came packed just right. Not a complaint."
0,Waste of time,"A lot of blabla about a minor testing of limited rules and then generalizing the results. Another example of a savantasse trying to impress others with ""scientifical evidence"" that is in fact no evidence at all. The man took clearly some shortcuts to state his case. He failed completely.However there are some usefull parts and if you're a statistics freak you might like it. But it does not add in any positive way to gain useable knowledge about technical analysis.Conclusion: not worth the money at all, relevant useable information minimal, too much text for such a minor and irrelevant research."
0,No Farscape,I recently read an article in TV Guide in which the makers of this series stated that they didn't want it to be escapism or fun. They certainly achieved their goal. It doesn't get much more mundane or unfun than this. Now more than ever I miss FARSCAPE!
1,So scary that I could not put it down.,"This is a great book because the author gives the reader little tips and clues that make you want to read more.I think this is a good sequel to Rosemary's Baby.From the first time I got my hands on it I knew that it was going to be scary.The best thing I like about this book is how Andy makes every one think that he is a good guy, but the mom thinks that every thing is weird."
1,Another masterpiesce from the great Roger Zelazny,This book touched me deeply ! It's not just made for fun to put it away and forget it...This book like all Zelazny's is made with it's own personality and charm which we cannot ignore... It's a shame that so many of his books are out of print now and so many readers don't have the oportunity to be put under the spell of Zelazny's magic and charm. The publishers must do something for that !
1,Two hot chicks with tats and bottles of booz,"i was just skipping through a few second hand CDs in the shop, when this little gem appeared. i looked at the picture and imagined it would sound like a light hearted riot grrrl piece of sexual brilliance and i was not at all dissapointed. i judged this book by its cover and i was right, so i give my self a rating of 5 stars for that and the CD a rating of 4 stars just cuz bikini kill and bratmobile get 5 so the budget girls cannot."
1,nice for figure skates,"I use them on my size 7 figure skates, and they fit perfectly. Easy to assemble, and comes in fun colors.When putting it on for the first few times, it might be a little difficult to put the blade in the slit, but after a few times it adjusted so its better.It works well, and its cute. But since I've never tried other brand, so I don't know how good they are, thus a 4 star."
1,Grateful,Couldn't find this in my area--so grateful to finally locate it. Product is excellent and arrived in very short time.
0,small bracelet,"the frogs in the picture are even smaller in person, and the bracelet barley fit in my wrist (i have very small wrists). you should buy an extender for this bracelet just in case."
1,Decent headset but nothing stupendous,"I've had this item for about 3 months now. It easily mated with my 5310 XpressMusic phone. The multi function button is easy enough to use to power on/off the device, answer/initate a call, increase/decrease volume. (Nokia's bluetooth connection is horrid and so is their voice recognition.) I removed the stock earpiece and attached a Jabra ear-gel pad for an even better fit. It feels comfortable when using for long periods. It sill seems a bit large but maybe I was spoiled by using a bluetooth set w/out a behind the ear arm. Call clarity is good both ways. Battery life is very good. My only real gripe is that the range for this set is pretty lame. I can only go about 7 feet from my phone before I get the Rice Krispies ""Snap, Crackle Pop!"" interference. I bought the set for $19.99 at the time. If you can get it for around price it'd be a solid buy."
0,Spanish Guitar...typical Toni by far.,"I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially ""Speaking In Tongues"" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what ""Speaking in Tongues is), and counted it as a bad investment until I heard ""Spanish Guitar"". Being more of a jazz aficionado, it's Toni's sultry voice that appeals to me most. Again, the verbal content is a bit for the younger, single audience but I think ""Spanish Guitar"" will appeal to the more mature audience. I hope it's made into a single!"

1,214 Reviews..Can We Talk? He Got You..Yes 'Marc Anthony',"He sure got me..Touch Me, Touch Me...This Man is Like 'The Best', Yes Most Definitely. Have you ever Had Your Soul Touched...He can Do That. Oh my goodness. ''My Baby You'' you will love this song. 'My Baby You Are The Reason I Can Fly'. Yes he will take you to the depths of your soul and then lift you to 'The Stars.' Saw him on Michael Jackson's 30th singing 'She's Out of My Life' and I'm sure the whole world went to buy his CD the very next day. I truly feel all the songs on this CD, you will die for. You Can Feel His Passion Like Wow...You Just Gotta get this CD. Words just cannot explain how Great This Man is. We need his kind of music to stimulate the senses and feel the Passion. And we all Love Passion. And Very Romantic..all ages would love this CD. ,.)Sincerely PrincessColleen xxO"
0,I'll never learn!,"This ""supposed"" hair curler is the biggest farce of a product I've ever encountered or wasted money on. After using it your hair still looks like you just crawled out of bed. From the clumsy curler to the way the curler mashes the hair, there is absolutely no way this product can leave you with a head of hair that you would take out in public. The only reason I still have it, is because I got sick and couldn't test it out before the 30 days were up. I just made some rich guy OR girl a little richer - story of my life. Bottom line. Don't waste your money."
1,I NEEDED A SYMPATHY LETTER.,This book is great if you don't want a Sympathy letter. It have many many sugestions for all other letters. Other wise I would have given it 5 stars. I was really surprised what letters they did have and no Sympathy.
0,OMGOSH! WAS THIS HEROINE STUPID!,"This supposedly intelligent professional heroine went on a $65,000 shopping spree the SECOND she discovered an insane amount of money deposited into her checking account without doing any follow-up on its authenticity during the infamous Millennium Y2K scare. Then, even when she starts to question the deposit, she's STILL writing out checks. If that wasn't bad enough, when the ""bad guys"" (we never find out who they were) begin to hunt her down, her brother and his good friend put their lives on hold and in danger to protect her while she spends her time bitching at them and causing unnecessary trouble. I'm ashamed to say (almost) that I was hoping a coyote would eat her.Besides all that, the story was WAY too slow and drawn out while the plot was terribly choppy. Many multiple sub-plots were introduced and then abruptly abandoned without explanations or conclusions. This book was definitely a waste of time."
1,Great movie,I bought it for a christmas present and it was well received. It is a classic movie with a lot of action.
0,An Okay Sci-fi Movie....,"I am a HUGE Karloff and Lugosi fan. I've lookedall over and finally found this movie hereon Amazon.com, so I snatched it up.This movie is Okay. It didn't grab me. In Fact,I put it on and found myself doing other thingsaround the house. It's a classic and it's good forwhat it is, and for the time that it came out,but I enjoy the Karloff/Lugosimovies The Raven and The Black Cat way more."
1,"""Little Savage"" reminds us of what is civilized, what not","Emily Fragos is our ambassador from the world of close, close attention being paid. Too often we rush by the best and worst of our human-ness, which is where the really interesting stuff is hidden. Poems like these remind us of what poetry is for--every line is under intense psychic pressure, there is not a shred of sentimentality, and not a word is wasted. ""Severe"" is not usually a word used as praise, but here it is very apt. ""Little Savage"" is wonderful."
0,STABBING PAIN,"I'm using the 15% - my dentist dropped me down to 15 from 20 because I went back after the first night with stabbing pain in one of my teeth. Stabbing has not gone away (it's weird, I wear the trays overnight and am awakened by a stab around 7 or 8 am.) It recurs somewhat during the day randomly, and is also bad when the teeth are exposed to cold. I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)I skipped a night after doing it 2 nights in a row, but tried it again last night and this morning - STAB. (That was after taking 1/2 a Vicodin as a precaution, last night.)This is NOT WORTH IT. I have had 2 stabbing pains in the time it took me to write this."
0,I say NO to this book!,"Why would I want a book that shows kids bad behavior? Why would I want to show my boys that other kids run naked in the street or pick their noses or write on the wall or make a muddy mess? That's how kids learn to do dumb things like that by seeing it from other kids - even kids in books. And even if they see the boy David getting in trouble for it, the idea to do it is now in their heads. It's like encouraging your kids to hang out with the bad kids in school. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that I paid money for this. I would much rather have a book that shows funny but GOOD behavior."
0,It is defective,"THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, TH CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, THE PROBLEM IS THE MUSIC STICKS BETWEEN 14TH & 15TH SONGS."
0,lasted 18 months :(,"I was really disappointed with this DVD player. Bought it less than 2 years ago and it stopped working. It would load a DVD and then turn itself off.It did play AVI files burned on CD's and DVD's though, but most do that now."
0,Worst of.....,"If, like me, you love to see Galactic live, do not buy this CD. I always felt like the Houseman was a necessary distraction for the band to keep the funk on the planet.This album is all Houseman and no funk! That is a crime!I don't mean that its not up to galactic funk standards, that would be one thing. I mean it is over-produced, the drums are so electronica they sound like drum machines. Are you kidding me, Stanton is funk soul of the band (the world?) and that it what they are reduced to?Are you getting the point. Even the lyrics suck. Nothing more than repeated choruses.Enough"
0,Compilation of BLM website forms,"This was a waste of money. The ""free"" land is not really yours to do with what you will. You cannot build a house on it or change it.The (very thin) book itself is nothing more than a few pages reprinted from a government website on filing MINING CLAIMS! You can have all of this information free by going to the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) website and looking up ""mining claims"".The Author Puts ""Dr."" in front of his name - turned out to be a divinity degree. What little he actually wrote (not more than a few pages total) is poorly written.LET THE BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Love it,We love this dart board. It is very nice and has the bears logo even on the darts! My only small complaint is there were just a few little nicks on the wood but honestly my dad may have done that while hanging it up. Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend!
0,this item sucks not even hot at all waste of money,this really isn't worth the money at all it is supposed to be hot and icy hot is about 10 time hotter than this product really its worthless don't spend your money on it i was really disappointed I have hotter reactions on my skin to camphor and its supposed to be 40hmu yeah right what a lie please don't buy if your looking for heated muscle rub
0,no luck,"Despite the good advice below, I never got the solid green light, only a flashing amber, which indicated the unit could not find the network. So after an hour or more putzing around with resets and so forth, gave up and returned it."
1,I <3 this book so much,"Part of one of my favorite series, I got this book a few months after I got the second book, along with the third. I read it cover to cover in 1 hour. I'm not much of a book person, but it was a realistic, funny book that I had to relate to. My favorite part was when Jamie and Isabella wore their fake disguises (sp?) so that they could pass their crushes house, but then their crush looks out the window, so then Isabella loses it and pushes Jamie, and then she runs six blocks, so then Jamie has to run six blocks to catch up with her friend! Isabella then sorta apoligizes, and she said it was only because there might be a bear coming torward them, and they didn't know. I would reccomend it for the ages 7-12. Very good job, Jim Benton! BTW, I'm going to read the 4th and 5th book soon!"
0,never recieved my books,i never recieved the book because you messed up with the shipping. I got my money back a month alter for it but i still never read it. i will never buy anything from amazon again. noone even offered to resend the book free of cost which they should have because i waited for it for so long. 3 different books i had this problem with.
0,Ours died too.,"We used our beloved panini maker probably once a month or so for about a year, but it died without warning, and way too soon."
0,Interesting Asian cases but text doesn't resonate,"As a collection of text and cases, this book is a hotchpotch read. Important subjects are discussed in vague terms with timeworn buzzwords tossed into the mix. Further, it is not firmly established what is meant to be instructional about some of the cases vis-a-vis the chapter contents. One thing I appreciate about Global e-commerce is the use of Asian cases which offer the reader a global perspective. It's good to hear of developments that don't have much coverage in the US, but I only wish the chapters shared this focus."
0,Third Man Aficianados Were Cheated,"Sorry to be negative, but the DVD version eliminated a key part of the entire film. You can fool most of the people, but not true aficionados who remember the original. A key part of the film occurs when Major Calloway takes Holly Martins on a tour of the hospital where children are dying as a result of Harry Lime's diluted pencillin sales. This was a pivotal scene. You cheated, folks! All the fancy technical tricks in the world can't make up for that omission. I feel robbed. The VHS version has it all, thank God."
1,comfortable belt for the overweight,Because I'am overweight I find it hard to get a belt that is comfortable and holds my trousers up.I have tried suspenders/braces and they unclip when I'am wearing them so I no longer use them.I'am 42 inch waist but I had 42 inch belt which was too big after wearing it for a couple of months so replaced it with a belt 4 inches smaller that is a size 38 and I find this satisfactory.I do reccomend this belt as it stretches as I sit down or contracts as I stand up where as a normal non stretch belt digs into my waist when I sit down and gets quite uncomfortable.The best long term solution is to lose weight.
1,A Must Read,"This book is a must read for all who want to understand why Europe:1. is failing in it's attempts to deal with muslim immigrants2. why muslims are not being integrated into european society3. why at the current birth rates, the european muslim population will become the majority in the near future and Europe will become Eurabia.This book should be compulsory reading for all Americans and especially our politicians. The Caged Virgin, by Hirsi Ali, continues this discussion focusing on the plight of muslim women and also offering suggestions to Western governments for dealing with muslims."
1,HISTORY WORTH READING,"Probably one of Jeff Shaara's best books to date, useing the same style of his father's excellent book on Gettysburg, ""Killer Angels"". While I consider myself more of a Civil War student, I read this book to learn a little more about the Revolution, a period I had very scanty detailed knowledge of. This book really delves into the day to day activities of the officers and men and brings you into this period very effectively. The novel sustains the actual history throughout, and in the style of his other books and his father's, the end brings out the later history of the key players - in this case, a sad ending for several dominant figures in the success of the Revolutionary War, who became broke and/or broken by the peace that followed. Even sadder, is that I never heard of several of these men, and their efforts should have made them American heroes in our history books. A worthwhile and interesting way to learn about the foundation of our country!"
1,Defending the Game,"Ok, so many people ripped apart this game. Personally, I didn't think it was that bad. My game has only crashed once, much less then BG2 when it first came out. It's one of those games that gets really bad if you don't like it.Problems:Long combat (slow game)Little choices (example you can cast level 8 spells but theres only one option for a class)Interface (takes time to figure out what things do)The manual is little helpKnowledge of D&D; is importantNot much of an RPGPositives:Great GraphicsRuns Smoothly (No jerky movements)Cool dungen crawl systemFun combat (Turns allow you to enjoy spells)Turn based system allows you to enjoy combatMany mini quests in a dungenmany itemsOverall I enjoyed the game, then again I got a great deal. It is definatly not worth [the money], but if you find it for a cheap price, I recommend getting it."
0,A major disapointment,"I am a huge fan of the first two BarlowGirl albums, but I must say this one is lacking severely compared to the first two. It starts off with one great rocker, and then immediately goes into two slow songs. After that it never really caught my attention because there was nothing there to get my attention.The remaining seven songs were all mid tempoed to slow songs that I just did not care for. I hope this is not the new path they are going down. This album is defnitely for a different crowd than the last two were. I desperately wanted to like this album, and I have been eagerly anticipating it for some time.I will put this disclaimer in here. I am not a fan of most bands in this genre. I like Killswitch Engage, Megadeth, As I Lay Dying, and Underoath, so maybe I am the exception and not the rule, but I doubt it."
1,Great,First time I sprout broccoli. It's easy and fast. I'm very satisfy with this product. I will definitely buy this product again.
0,Materials Science & Metallurgical student from Michigan Tech,"Thermodynamics is already a hard enough subject to learn. If you want to learn thermo this is the wrong book for you. Gaskell confused my whole class so much that we hardly even used this book, fortanetly we had a good professor that was able to make sense of what Gaskell had to say. There are so many errors in this book that it is pathetic not just in the answers but also in the tables that Gaskell provides. Gaskell himself came and lectured our class this term. Luckly for him it was early in the term when we were just starting to use the book, if he had came in later in the term he would have been beaten senseless with this horrible book."

1,This is the best ever recorded,"I'm a huge fan of all Rage records but this one top all his followers. Its pure energy. Zack de la Rocha raps with the fury and such anger I'ver never seen before. And unlike many others singers in this genre(Limb Bizkit)his lyrics really mean something. Tom Morello makes some of the sickest sounds ever made by a guitar and the rythem-section(Timmy C. and Brad Wilk) make Rage the most powerful band ever.'Bullet in the head' starts of with a funky bass line and explodes in the end with Zak chanting ""A bullet in the head"". My favourites are 'Take the power back','Wake Up' and 'Freedom' although i must say that all tracks are simply amazing. Their political oppinion can be clearly seen and even if you do not agree with them you have to admit that they do something for their believes. I personally got much more interested in social matters and inform myself of whats going on in this world. INFORMATION IS POWER, THINK FOR YOURSELF"

0,Far left wing liberal!!,"Let me start by stating the simple facts: 1.) the media is by far a liberal organization. They will pull anything to attack Bush or the republicans. If the writer is correct about what he was saying: where in the world was the media? It seems to me they missed a huge story!! 2.) If Al Gore was all about protecting the rights of voters, Why didn't he say something? Or would it not be the right thing to do? Apparently Al Gore and the rest of the democrats let the voters down with their silence. Why are they not saying something now? This is nothing more than a lame attempt to degrade the President of the United States, and the Govenor of Florida. Not to mention try and divide our nation at a time when we should be pulling together as a nation behind our leader and looking to the future! I strongly urge all Americans not to buy this book and further divide our nation. Instead help bring us closer together to make it through such a hard time in our history."
1,Very good step-by-step progression for learning C#,Great learning material. Following the examples and the natural progression of the book is a great method for learning C# with practical examples. Very straight forward approach without being too verbose.
0,I couldn't even finish it...,"Whilst some of the period detail is well researched I found the plot predicatble in the extreme. The characters very one dimensional, so much so they might have said ""Hello, I'm the evil villan"", ""Hello, I'm the handsome hero"" and so on.As the heroine is supposed to be a herbalist and healer being taught by a ""witch"", why didn't Chadwick do research into medieval witchcraft? She appears to have read a Wicca 101 book and taken that as historically accurate. A Saxon (yes, SAXON) witch babbling about the Maid, Mother and Crone? Come ON, you don't even have to do a LOT of research to be able to tell the difference between Saxon beliefs and modern Wicca!!!Very poor as far as I got (and that wasn't very far)."
0,Portable Crib Mattress,The mattress cannot be used with mesh sided cribs so it is not very useful. It also did not seem like it would be very comfortable for a baby to sleep on.
1,great,you can use this on any airsoft guns i bought it for my sniper rifle but this is great i recommend getting this from a airsoft website or on amazon but where ever you buy it make sure its made from an airsoft company and it is 100% silicone oil or else it can break you gun which would suckgreat product
0,Self Promotion,"The author is very biased and introduces theories by other thinkers in strongly negative terms before 'attempting' to 'explain' their views in a coherent way. This book is not so much about Mysticism in my view, but the self promotion of the Dogmatic limited philosophy of Ralph Inge. By 'mind-reading' what he believes some of the great thinkers' motivations were and dismissing them as ludicrous makes this a very hard read, full of negative and depressing words. Open minded books with insights into true Mysticism and Gnostic realities for those seeking to understand and learn are plentiful and this book should be avoided."

0,informitive but QBASIC is no longer in Windows 98,This book is very informitive in nature but it based everything in it's contents to QBASIC. QBASIC is no longer in Microsoft Windows 98. So if you are running 98 do not get this book; unless you have no idea what you computer is than it is a very informitive book.
0,Decent - but beware of errors,"I found this book to be a fair representation of what is on the i-Net+ exam. However, using the book to study was very frustrating - it has several errors, contradictions and the software was inaccurate in some places. Compared to the test, I found this book verbose and somewhat of an overkill. In fact, I purchased it because it was the first to market in January. I sat for the exam today and passed (barely) but feel that Syngress could have done a much better job editing this book or at least offering a patch for the study guide. Considering the relatively high price, I would recommend going to another publisher."

0,"Does not measure up, sorry.","Do not be fooled by the immitation ""greatest hits"" song list. The actual songs by Kraftwerk sound much differnt. If you buy this CD, it should be because of its originality, not its likeness to Kraftwerk."
1,A VERY Underrated Album,"I stumbled upon this CD recently and just decided to check it out. I had never heard of Kerri Anderson before, but my first reaction was ""OK she looks a little like Alicia Keys"". Well, she doesn't SOUND like Alicia Keys, this girl can actually carry a tune. She has one of the smoothest voices I have ever heard. Now it may not be the most unique voice, but I fell in love with her music instantly. Imagine if Melissa Etheridge, Pat Benatar and Patti Smyth had a child. Here she is.The album starts out with her first (and probably only) release, ""Ghosts"". (Check out the video on LAUNCH) A VERY emotional and beautiful song. As the album progresses it goes from smooth and almost ambient to almost AOR music on a couple tracks. However mixed the musical styles are, the point is, Kerri Anderson had SUCH potential before she fell from the face of the earth.So don't let the ""discount"" price fool you, pick this disc up and listen to one of the lost treasures of nineties music."
1,"Finally, a perfect corporate communications book","As a corporate writer, I found Lecia's book incredibly helpful. Even with a decade of experience, I picked up some wonderful insights, excellent tips, and useful hints and ideas. This book is a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to break into the world of corporate writing. And for those already there - buy this and use it every day. You'll be glad you did."
1,cute movie,"Although I was a bit skeptical at first, I found that I really liked and enjoyed this movie.To me, it was a really pleasant and positive movie, and the attack of the killer cheese puffs really cracked me up.The dvd extras include how to draw some of the characters, some fun and games as well as a great activity to try with your family, and an alternate ending which I thought was pretty cute.Oh yeah, there is a song called ""rock monster"" which is a parody of the song ""rock lobster"" by the b-52's. I really loved that part and had that song stuck in my head for the next day or so.So, you should give this movie a try. It's got a great message in it that I think applies to everyone."

0,sloppy writing,"I ordered this book assuming to get something useful, but i got the impression while reading the book that it is like a collection of notes from other books, wrapped with some matlab code. More worrying to me was that the mathematics makes a sloppy impression. For me that means I cannot grab the book to lookup something and use the code without having to be concerned on the validity. The bottomline being I will not use it for applications and the book is a waste of money."
1,Great Read,Great read and involved plot. I think this is a more mature Mitch and at the same time has other characters with depth and side plots. Well done
0,Pretentious and Silly,"This album blew. The lyrics are childish and the music is derivative. I love all of the bands Amazon has hooked this album up with, but the recommendations are misleading -- despite the 5 starts, this CD is a waste of money."
1,This book is pure fun,This is one of my favourite craft books. Most of the projects are fairly quick so making gifts that people will love is a breeze. I helped a friend who had never sewed before make Steve the cat. She was so happy with it. Her husband couldn't believe that she had made it herself. This a great book to get people excited about sewing because a beautiful and inexpensive project can be completed in less than 2 hours. I hope Denyse will write another book soon. I'd love to see Steve the dog and some funky bags and hats.
1,Love this!!!,"Got this for our 20 month old daughter's playroom, as she is very tall for her age and all of the other slides out there she could practically reach the floor while sitting on the top of the slide. She LOVES it! It is not too tall for her to climb and it gives her enough room to slide. We are currently using it indoors and will probably take it outside in the spring."
1,Not just for Women!,"What a wonderful collection of women poets! Everyone knows about Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath, who made wonderful contributions to the world of poetry, but this collection takes it to the next level by offering such a mix of wisdom from very talented, but not as often read, poets. I recommend this collection to anyone who is interested in expanding his/her knowledge and appreciation of poetry."
1,Explicit lyrics????,"The first (and maybe the only) record I have that has a sticker that says ""parental advisory explicit lyrics"". Though not everyone will enjoy loud belching sounds, I think that this is one of the best renaissance records you can buy."

1,there was life before Type O...,"this was Pete Steele's band in the 80's before Type O Negative were around. as a matter of fact, their first album Slow Deep And Hard unofficially, was actually supposed to be Carnivore's third album. anyway, Carnivore only put out 2 albums. their self-titled debut was ok, but this 2nd album was far superior. in fact, I think Retaliation is probably one of the most under-rated albums that came out on Roadrunner records in the late-80's. pure early crossover NYC thrash/punk. its right up there with albums by The Accused, Crumbsuckers, DRI, and Gang Green."
1,Comfortable wireless keyboard,"This is a well-designed keyboard and mouse combo that is easy on the tendons. I really like the ergonomic keyboard though the split key layout takes a little getting used to. The mouse isn't quite as ergonomic as the Evoluent mouse I have, but it does have a more vertical position than the standard design. My main gripe is that on my Vista desktop, there were occasional stutters of the keyboard. Lost keystrokes and unresponsive keys can be very frustrating! If that was my only use of it, I would have returned it. But I tried it on my Windows 7 Dell laptop and it worked perfectly so it's a keeper after all. No wires AND an ergonomic experience? Way to go!"
0,Disappointing,"We have only the paring knife from this set, and havebeen very disappointed with it. Our experience was almostidentical to that of Roy Sweeting, who has also reviewedit here. The knife lost its edge quickly, and worse yet,fell apart a few months after we bought it. The bladeseparated from the handle while cutting an apple."
1,Great for the fisherman,"Although the intended purpose is mostly for a surfer, my husband LOVES his watch for the use of being informed about the tides in our area for fishing. The instructions for setting up the watch were a bit confusing at first, but with a little attention it is a hurdle well worth overcoming for the payoff of the local information."
0,2-1/2 stars -- They drop the same album every year,"I'm not questioning The Donnas' talent, because they do have some, but it's really hard to tell when you can't really tell the difference between this and their other albums. I mean, really - haven't the girls learned yet that there are more topics for songs besides drinking and college-style partying (oops, I'm sorry - their first album was about HIGH SCHOOL-style partying)?And a lot of these songs are style over substance, which is really obvious by just looking at some of the titles alone, like ""Take Me To The Backseat"" and ""You Wanna Get Me High"". And their latest single ""Who Invited You"" is about two-and-a-half minutes long, and it sounds like that's how long it took to write it.There are some good songs on here like ""Take It Off"". Also, the music on the album is really good. But as far as subject matter goes, they seriously need to expand their horizons."
1,Great followup to excellent first movie,"Couldn't pass up buying this movie when it was dirt cheap at $10!Iron man is one of my sons favorite action stars and he watches the first two movies over and over.I like the overall story, think it was a great follow up to first movie, and cant wait for the next one due out 2013."
0,No longer a good product,I can NOT get this software to work because they have implemented some kind of new internet registration this year.
0,Could of been great,"The first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner. After that things went amiss. You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o's I found. It got to the point where I just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration. I could go on but then I would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair."
0,Deflates significantly every night,"This ball is a bad product, as it deflates so significantly between every use (daily) that I have to pump it up again for at least a full minute. Do others have this problem? I'm going to try to return it."
0,"A HugeDisappointment , Self Serving KAFFIR BOY IN AMERICA","Way to go Mark, 303 pages of patting yourself on the back, Boy your arm must hurt. I enjoyed ""Kafir Boy"" and was looking forward to reading what happened to Mark after he came to America. What happened Mark?"
0,Why is this wipe so highly rated?!?,"I use and very much like the Seventh Generation diapers. I purchased these wipes today based on the favorable and high recommendations posted on amazon.com ... and, for the life of me, cannot understand why there are so many 5-star ratings!Yes, this non-chlorinated, low-toxin, environmentally-friendlier wipe earns points for being just that, but, for performance, this wipe feels and works like the equivalent of 3 squares of 1-ply toilet paper. I am willing to think that perhaps I bought a bunk package (I sure hope I did!) because the wipe is so, so small and seems really, really dry ... hard enough to use for clean-up of a wet diaper, I shudder to think how many wipes it would take -- and how messy the process would be -- to clean a bum that had a soiled diaper!I am headed out tomorrow to get something else."
0,All out foolishness!,"This is a phony rap type group who looks foolish, acts foolish and their music(!) is horrible. As an actor, I would not want to mention this on my resume!This film seeks to play on all of the most memorable sterotypes of the so-called blacxploitation films of the 1970's. Except that the cast is mainly white with corny rapper wannabes. ""Insane Clown Posse."" If the name alone does not let you know not to take them seriously, then the makeup should. Is that does not work, then there is their music. Stay away from anything with their name on it.Don't get me wrong, I like foolish ""B"" movies, but the qulaity kind. Cliches in film show no originality and just an effort to say that they made a movie. This sucks."
0,Only lasted 2 1/2 years before the light assembly cracked!,"I keep my home at 78 degrees,so I had to take the heater out as I could never get the aquarium cool enough. I clean it every 10-14 days,and the water stays crystal clear with a wall of bubbles,air stone,(not a wand which clogs). All the pet shops carry the system 12 filters.I get the 3-pk for $9.98 which you change once a month,rinsing the filter out when cleaning the tank,in between the monthly.After the light assembly in the hood developed many hairline cracks and one quite wide crack. I gave my fish to the pet shops and put the aquarium away,for possible critter use for my granddaughter in the future,but I would not recommend this hood and light fixture for any aquarium!"
1,Surface Water-Quality Modeling,Pro: I knew the book is excellent because I have read a major portion before purchase. I bought it because it is an excellent reference book for water quality studies. The book is no longer in print but Amazon sold a copy to me in SI unit.Con: Amazon packing is terrible and caused multiple dog ears to my new book. Can Amazon be more professional in the packaging department please.
0,"Disappointing Product, Disappointing Service","...I purchased the DWL-900AP+ and the DWL-520+. The DWL-900AP+ was shipped by Amazon.com, the DWL-520+ by Tech Depot - wish I had realized that sooner - I now have two returns to manage instead of one.I followed the instructions to install the 520 in my XP desktop. The DLink utility did not install - no desktop icon was created (the instructions said there would be one). When I double-clicked the icon in my task bar, a different screen displayed than the one in the instructions.I contacted tech support, and after about a half hour on the phone, the DLink tech rep said to return the devices, they must be faulty. I can't contact Tech Depot to issue the RMA until Monday. I have to submit a separate return request for the access point. Two returns even though I place the order on the same website..."
1,Wow,"You have to wonder how something this prolific and so personal became so widespread, but this book explains it. It doesn't seem to take either side of the issue, but just presents the facts as best they can be told. You can decide for yourself what you think about the topic, but the book treats both sides fairly."
1,kit was a perfect fit. shipped fast.,"The gear on the central part shown in pic, sheared off the shaft of my 17 year old opener. I took the opener down and saw that the rest of it was in really good shape so i decided to fix it. I could have bought a new opener, but the new ones are not built like this one and would require me moving hangers and running wires to get it installed.Ordered this kit, and had the opener fixed in a couple of hours. And of course I was able to use the existing hangers and sensors so that saved me time too.The part is really high quality and even came with lithium grease to re-lube everything. It shipped fast too."
0,Songs great..quality not so much.,"I absolutely love the compilation; however, I had to put the volume up to 28 on my JBL system in my car, just to hear the lyrics. The digital quality is terrible."
0,"Could be interesting, but WAY over my head . . .","The idea of a quantum computer is quite fascinating. Since a colleague of mine studied quantum computing at Oxford, I thought I might read up on the subject. My expectations were that ""The Quest"" would be something that would get the lay reader up to speed. I don't mind being stretched a bit (I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering), but the book was just way too over the top for any not intimately familiar with quantum physics. The book contains a lot of interesting information, but it is sandwiched between some very difficult concepts and nomenclature. Remember, ""know your audience . . ."""
1,Inspiring.,This book is very inspiring. It makes you want to be a better christian. It shows you the struggles that past christians have had.I don't know about you but this was a very inspiring book for me!Amanda
1,Stir Fry pan,very happy with this Stir-Fry pan. Make great tasting meals and is very easy to clean up. Like the see thru lid. It came quickly to. Couldn't be happier. Thank you for a great product.
0,Do not work,I put the batteries in the headset and plugged in the base to charge the headphones but nothing happened. The light to indicate that the set was charging didn't illuminate. I left the set plugged in for two days and still nothing.
0,Harman Kardon Soundsticks II quality,I ordered Harmon Kardon Soundstick II and I returned them.I own Harmon Kardon Soundstick I and I must say that these speakers don't compare with the Harmon Kardon Soundstick II. The sound quality is very poor. On a scale of 1-10 I would say it is a 2 at best. Don't buy these. Harmon Kardon should go back to the old style of speakers with the USB instead of the new plugs.
0,Returning this ASAP!,This cushion is way too wide for for the car seat in my Nissan or for my behind. It made the problem worse.
0,It was okay,"Really the story had potential. Unfortunately it never reached it. Most of the scenarios are just plain ridiculous. Especially the leads and their interaction about divorce and all that. And more so with the villain. I mean, Really come on. Quite silly."
1,A very enjoyable soup,"I definitely consider these soups to be over priced but this soup is extremely tasty and well worth the Amazon price after their additional special sale is also deducted. The problem with most canned soups, and this is absolutely no exception, is that the salt content of one can fulfills 100% of every individual's daily requirement of sodium. And they don't even use Sea Salt or other more natural salts instead of the artificially man made damaging chemically altered salt. I know that this salt makes up a good portion of the volume and weight of each can but it is killing our society and should be replaced and eliminated. Someone must know how to 'can' a tasty, lower, good salt soup?"
0,"No, thank you","This book... where to even start. I think it would be very easy to accept what this book says if you had never really studied American history from a non-white perspective.He never explores the creation of a white America. He does not acknowledge the violence of assimilation. He almost completely disregards non-European immigrations. He never questions the myths of white America.Reading this book, I was convinced that he was a conservative."
1,A Nice Surprise,I bought this book because I bought some other Frank Asch books and I really like this one also. It is a great book that shows the relationship between a father and child.
1,"Powerfully breathtaking, a masterpiece of a film!","Steven Spielberg is a master at what he does, there is no reason why this film should not have won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, emotionally draining, and terrifying portrayal of men at war. It is brutal but honest, and gives the viewer a true sense of belonging in an infantry platoon. The films touch of authenticity is, once again, a great credit to Cpt Dale Dye, who worked on ""Platoon"". Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance as does the rest of its cast. Being a Gulf War veteran, this film does hit hard, but it is about as close to combat as anyone sober would want to be."
0,Not terrible...,"After hearing about this when it was being promoted on the Howard Stern show I decided to pick one up. The shaver itself has a nice comfortable design. However, as noted in other reviews, the guides are awful. They do not do a good job of guiding the hair to the blades, making your trimming look uneven and sloppy. Another problem I have had is when trimming without the guides the blade unit has a tendecy to pop right out of the shaver. Sure it easily snaps back into place, but itis annoying and can easily mess up what you are doing. This product is a great idea, but something really needs to be done about how well it works with the guides, as I don't always want to go down to bare skin."
1,Excellent Mount,This friction mount work great. You will never think of using the sucktion cups again.
0,poor quality,"As mentioned in other reviews the instructions are bad and the pictures and hardware don't necessarily match the guide.The visible pieces are nice but the drawers and inside pieces are made of really poor particle board...sub-par even for particle board. If you are buying this as a changing table to use for a year or two it might last that long. If you want it as a dresser that will last beyond that, spend your money on something else. The finish scratches very easily also."
1,Does what I expected.,"I bought these dollies to allow me to push my incapacitated 911 around in my garage, and they do the job as expected. They are solidly built and roll easily. My only quibble, and it's minor, is that they ship unassembled i.e. you have to bolt the casters onto the trays yourself, and that took a little time."
1,Great!,"I am a jazz fan and this is my first Joe Pass CD, and I just loved it.I would recommend it to anyone and everyone :-)"
0,not accurate,"This movie is a terrible way to ""honor"" such a great book. In the movie you do not see the symbolism, and it is not true to the text at all. In the movie Dimmsdale doesn't die as he is supposed to in the novel. How could someone take such a good movie and make it into Demi Moore trash???? If you want to know about the scarlet letter i am sure has a great copy of the BOOK for sale. Trust me it is 100% better."
1,one of the better Sisters tributes,"As of this writing, there are 5 different tribute CDs devoted to the Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps this is to be expected, given that the Sisters themselves have not released a proper album in over a decade. This release from Sweden, as you may have guessed, consists largely of deep-voiced bands with metal overtones to their music. Considering the competition, though, I thought all the music here was very enjoyable. The track listing:1. Poison Door - Bay Laurel2. Some Kind of Stranger - Mist Of Avalon3. Alice - Mobile Mob Freakshow4. Floorshow - Headtrip Inc.5. Body and Soul - Funhouse6. Vision Thing - Sex Sex Sex7. Body Electric - Dawn Of Oblivion8. On a Wire - Sons Of Neverland9. Lucretia My Reflection - Dan Swanö10. First and Last Always - Darkside Cowboys11. Something Fast - Snow Storm12. Temple of Love - DesireIf you are looking for something good to listen to while holding your breath until the new Sisters album is released, you have found it."
1,Cool chords,This is a great tool for the very beginning guitar learner.When I have more time to devote to guitar playing I will use this product a great deal.
1,A must have for LOTR fans and collectors,"I am a huge lifetime fan of this genre. Tolkien was a tremendously gifted author and the LOTR series of books has had a huge impact worldwide from the time it was first released. I was excited when I heard that the series was going to be made into a movie. However, as happens so often when trying to take a story of this magnitude and put it on the silver screen, I was afraid that the movie would fall short of the expectation. I'm happy to say the movie exceeded the expectation. And while some would say the original was too long, all I could say was give me more. The extended versions fulfill that request. And, while I was disappointed that the movie did not include the return to the Shire at the end, it is still one of the greatest movies of all time. As stated previously, if you are a fan of LOTR, the extended additions are a must-buy."
1,Excellent,This is an excellent quality case for a low price. I got exactly what I was looking for. Well designed. A must for someone who travels a lot and needs to bring ties along. No regrets with this purchase.
0,Tablets Taste Disgusting,"Before giving these vitamins to my picky son, my boyfriend and I decided to guinea pig ourselves. I GAGGED after chewing two tablets, my boyfriend screamed for water. So, I'm not sure if the wafers are a better route to go. My son will not eat these. I'm going to try and find a way to hide these in his food."
0,"Interesting, but ultimately unlistenable","I've listened to a lot of Coltrane's stuff, and I'd say this is one of the worst albums. Om is a good track, but Ascention is simply abyssmal. I read somewhere that the musicians were on acid when the recording was made and it shows. 40+ minutes of pure agony, twice. If you're looking for essential Coltrane, this is not the place to start. I put ""Crescent,"" ""A Love Supreme,"" and the ""The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings"" at the top of my list, and this one at the bottom. This album is purely for those interested in knowing what a great musician sounds like when he lets go completely."
1,A Classic. Period.,"Main Source's sells struggled with Extra-P at the helm. But the group eventually died without him. The Large Professor is a genius and Breaking Atoms is an early glimpse into the creative tapestry of the man who would eventually rise to bring us the rapper nas and the hottest tracks on his debut opus, Illmatic. The unfortunate part of this story is that Extra-P has dissapeared in a time when true hip-hoppers need a man like him the most."
0,Revisionist History,"The founding fathers were freethinkers and Deists. And Tom Paine was an Atheist. Meacham should do some actual research, instead of trying to cuddle up to the Christian theocrats."
0,impossible to follow,"The Alec Guinness version is so much better there is no comparison possible. This shortened version of the novel is next to impossible to follow. It is merely random bits and pieces of the story with no continuity or context. Oldman's acting is almost non-existent. At the end you find out who the mole is, but you have no idea whatsoever of how he was identified."

0,Dull,"I'm glad (sorta) I got this on unabridged audio CD. I'd never have finished it otherwise. I've written every fiction book Crichton has written. So I bought this the minute it came out. Frankly, it's boring. It's all preach, preach, preach. Global Warming is a lie he asserts, and has to beat it into our heads repeatedly. If you agree with him or not, the story is slow and cliched. Seems like he has lost his touch."
0,Not very helpful...zzzzz,"After using other Sams learn it all in 21 days books, I was eager to use this one. Tood bad, because I kept losing track of what was going on. Too boring, too meandering. I got through the first week and can't bear to touch it again."
1,German I: Pimsleur Comprehensive,I found this to be a great program and I would recommend it to anyone who desires to begin learning a new language. I have the abridged Intermediate course also and when I get through that I'll be getting the Pimsleur Comprehensive German II series. I also purchased an abridged Spanish course for a friend to try out and I am confident he will get the entire set.
1,This Disney film was SURPRISINGLY GOOD!,"Okay, I have to admit that sometimes I judge animated disney films by the looks of the characters; like I did with ""The Emperor's New Groove"". I didn't even plan on watching this. But, my uncle had the DVD, so I decided to give it at least a try. It was one of the greatest Disney films ever! The plot wasn't boring at all, like I thought it would be. The characters were really entertaining. Especially Yzma's dumb sidekick, Kronk. This film was so touching. You know, Koozko risking his chance to become a human once again just to save Pacha from falling. This film ended with a great song that had a touching message.I even cried a little at the end of this film. :)"

1,WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS INCREDIBLE CD,"I love music of all genres: r&b;, country, rock, you name it... THIS CD is definitely in my top three of ALL TIME.His voice is so soulful, smooth and flat out amazing. The tracks range from sexy ballads to danceable, bass-filled grooves. I CANNOT take it out of my cd player.Top picks: ""7 Days"", ""Rendezvous"", ""Walkin Away"", and ""Once in a Lifetime."" The ""Fill Me In Part Two"" is cool also. The only song I can do without it ""Booty Man"", as it is pretty cheesy!You will LOVE this CD!!!!!"
1,Welcome to the 80s (Part II),"I first took notice of the opening track ""Chicago Song"" during Roman Polanski's film ""Frantic"" (Harrison Ford). Sanborn's music really made that scene memorable. Ford's character is on the trail of his kidnapped wife and visits a chic Paris disco called the ""Blue Parrot"". Everyone is decked out in 80s designer clothes. Ford meets this Jamaican cocaine dealer, all the while ""Chicago Song"" is pumping the energy of the club. It was definitey good times in Paris.... Thank Sanborn for the soundtrack to an era....lots of gated drum sounds and slick mixing, and of course the top studio players backing him up. This is music from the Miami Vice era and it sound just as uplifting today! Sanborn is still making waves on the international jazz festival scene - he's a legendary R&B tenor man with a sound everyone tries to imitate."
1,Keeps me on track!,"I had been looking for a pedometer that seemed substantial, so many of them feel cheaply made and don't seem to really count steps accurately. I have been really happy with the Omron HJ-112. Although is not small, it does fit into a pocket easily or attach to my waistband and is not uncomfortable to carry.I love that the HJ-112 keeps track of miles walked, steps, and calories. The fact that it stores 7 days worth of data is so helpful. This little device has really helped me want to stay active and strive to walk more every day."

1,Longing for A Continuation,"This book was recommended to me by a sixth-grade school teacher that I met at a bookstore one day. She was interested in writing books for children; along with this book she bought The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander. I bought it without really knowing what to expect and was very surprised. This book is very interesting and I plan to read or listen to it again some day. My family and I are very much interested in Celtic and Welsh legends anyway. One thing that I think is very ironic is that Will is extremely young and yet so very old. (Example: The Rider's visit to the Stanton family at Christmas) I went on to read the book Greenwitch and became interested in the friendship that sprang up between Will and Jane. I can't help wishing that Susan Cooper would one day bring the characters back at a later time when they are older. Yes, being grown now I crave a little romance, and I would like to see Will with female companionship."
0,"The most pompous, least useful magical study ever ever.","I've had only two reactions from this book: falling asleep or laughing. Repressed Regardie is far from my favorite author, or any useful author in particular; I've only found his works, ""The Golden Dawn"" and ""A Garden of Pomegranates"" to be mildly useful. ""Tree of Life"" seems to be one long, drawn-out, arrogant criticism of other practices, and indeed other magicians. The information is exceptionally watered-down and seemingly copied from his superiors in the Golden Dawn (namely, Aliester Crowley, who is a ""lesser"" to him). Armchair magicians don't have much purpose in general, and Regardie certainly falls easily into that category!"
0,"Kind of weak, but pleasant anyway","This album sounded uninspired. Don't get me wrong, I love Journey, and I have this album. The two best songs are the first and last (a bonus track). ""Message Of Love"" sounds like a leftover from Frontiers. The musicianship on this CD is tight and performed well. It's just that it is kind of boring, I expected a little more. It couldn've happened with another release WITH Steve Perry. I knew that if they had one more chance after Trial that we'd have a 4 or 5 star album on our hands. Unfortunately, that isn't gonna happen."
1,I love this book,"I absolutely love Salinger's work. This collection of short stories is definitely one of the best I know of. It shows you the deeply spiritual side of Salinger with stories like ""Teddy""; other stories are so touching I can't say enough about them."
0,From verse to worse,"Some of the ideas for these poems are whimsical and cute. However, I mourn for the lost art of versification in this country. Koontz may be a good novelist, but if he writes a line of verse that scans, it's probably by accident. The rules of prosody aren't terribly hard to learn -- why is no one bothering with them any more? Worst of all, why doesn't anybody care?Ah well. Koontz is trying to be the next Shel Silverstein, but Shel knew how to write a line that sings. Koontz doesn't."
1,NOT Clash of Civilizations but contact and mutual borrowing,"At least until recent times major civilizations gradually shared, adapted, borrowed, and sometimes transfromed material elements of civilization and even ideas. A wonderful overview of history before European colonialism introduces eaxamples and processes for a valuable perspective that should be read by area specialists and others tending to see things from the view of a single nation, faith, or culture. The pace and shock of change increased with modern communications and powerful force producing perhaps a different story from the period after that so well reviewed in this book. One might start with Phillip Curtin and Wolf's ""peoples without history' for this later period."
1,Great tune!,"The Prodigy are back!""Baby's Got A Temper"" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless, dire amounts of pop-garbage.The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes don't vary too much from the originaltrack, being a dub and instrumental (respectively). I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said, ""Baby's Got A Temper"" is such a great,catchy song, that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust can't get enough of the tune itself anyway!:) Great video too!!Absolutely recommended!"
1,Great Watch!,"I had this identical watch for several years, but an unfortunate accident brought it to an early demise. I didn't order a replacement for over a year. But now, that I've received it I am happy I finally followed through. I happen to have thin wrists and the Skagen watch fits perfectly and doesn't overwhelm visually. The Skagen offers great value and to me is aesthetically pleasing. Great job, Skagen."
1,"Pretty Good, and worth a looksee (is that how you spell it?)","Although I was expecting this to be right up there with Batman: The Long Halloween. It wasn't. It was, however a pretty good story seemed cut short for some reason. I gave it 4 out of 5 because I dont think I would ever buy it hardcover."
0,Broke!!!,"This is my second Gorrilla Pod from Joby. The first one served me pretty well for our point and shoot camera. It was sooooo highly praised by each and every person who saw it, even strangers...tht i thought I would gift it to someone I knew would use it because I could always buy a new one. So, I placed the order once again for another one because it has become indispensable for us. Also, I went for Joby even though there were other cheaper ones available for 5-8 dollars or so. I was apprehensive due to their bad reviews and Joby sounded more promising...and why not, it was so expensive. It was expected to serve me well.But I was wrong. It broke. I have used it for not more than 2 months or so...and its already useless. I am not if I can get a refund or not. Neither am I sure of going for Joby again. its disappointing and shameful because I see too many reviews on these lines now. That is so unfair on Joby's part to make such defective pieces and sell them too."
0,Makes natural hair dry,"As I went through the reviews, I noticed some women said it made their hair soft, others said their hair broke off. I decided to give it a try.

0,An unsatisfying diatribe,"The author neither understands ""liberalism"" nor Catholicism. The author apparently views ""liberism"" as an ahistorical event. He places the responsibility for the society's woes on it. Never paying attention to the fact the world is not governed by ""liberal"" political thought the author nonetheless can't wait to blame it for almost every imaginable problem extant or developing. I am left to assume the author does not value the United States, its freedoms, democracy, and gifts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. All direct descendents of ""liberalism"" I get the uneast feeling that if this were 1776 the author would be touting the philosophy of King George; the anti-thesis of liberalism. I have impression he is afraid of the very freedom the United States holds out as an example to the world."

0,Outdated and incorrect,"I began using this book to prep for my trust and estates final exam, but I immediately found some obvious errors. I'm not sure if the errors are a result of it being outdated or the author incorrectly reading the UPC and state statutes. Regardless I found several errors in the first section alone and immediately stopped using it."
1,Sullivan tells it like it is.,"Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Ms. Sullivan's book is the accuracy with which she portrays the participants in her anecdotes. As I covered Bradley's campaign for Reuters, I came in contact with many of the players, and upon reading the book was struck by the generosity and penetration that were displayed in turns. Without overtly caricaturing her subjects, Ms. Sullivan has managed to emphasize many of the quirks that typify people on the campaign trail."
1,24 KARAT GOLD,"The only thing wrong with this album is its name; the phrase ""24 KARAT GOLD"" should be replaced with ""PLATINUM"". This is a must have collector's item. It would be disastrous if we went into next millenium without this valuable artifact.Everyone should have this reggae bible.Trust me you won't need skip any of the tracks when get this cd; if you do you may e-mail your expletives to me at gawain@ignmail.com."
1,Rave reviews from food allergy support group,"I run a support group for families of children with severe, life-threatening food allergies. This book has received rave reviews from many members of our group, especially those who are coping with multiple food allergies."
0,Decent Album from Seductive Southern Songtress,"Ignore my 2 star review that I originally rated this album with. Instead I now give this disc 3 stars because it is a decent effort now that I've listened to it, and it is growing on me. Those who fell in love with Tweet because of her suggestive songwriting, and Timbaland club beats will be a bit disappointed. There is no Timbaland on any of these tracks, but Missy does show up on a few cuts which are some of the highlights. I could do without a few songs which would probabaly make this album tighter. Despite the little flaws I have with this album, I'd recommend it more for mature young adults and the 25+ crowd. Highlights hear include ""Iceberg"", ""Could It Be"", ""Cabride (Taxi)"", ""Steer"", and ""We Don't Need No Water""."
1,Overall a Truthful Account of a Dark and Bloody Time,"While Oliver Stone's 60's-style ""hipness"" intrudes too much into the characters and situations, overall the film is a good and honest portrayal of the Nazi-like terror inflicted on this country by police and military beasts in human form. Having been associated with Amnesty International at this time I'm well aware of the real people who were tortured, mutilated, raped, murdered, and ""disappeared"" in the name of ""Western Values."" This film not only portrays the true face of El Salvador's bloody and evil little civil war, but of the moral callousness of the US in funding this descent into hell. The US self-righteousness over Bosnia and Kosovo a decade or so later seems all the more incredible, as one watches American complicity with mass murder here."
1,Kapoosh,"These things are great!!! I have three and don't use the original knife holder that came with my knives. They hold tons of knives, scissors and my steel. Reccommend to everyone. Also, Bed BATH and Beyond says this style is no longer being made so if you already own one and want another to match you'd better get now before they run out."
0,Think twice,"I bought 2 sets and some separate pieces, one set was ok, the second had two broken pieces: a cup and an 11.5 inch dinner plate, as I had acquired some separate pieces I decided not to return the box, besides I liked the design. After two weeks of using the sets, one dinner plate showed a discoloration and two salad plates broke in the microwave oven, I have decided to return one of the sets, I really question Pfaltzgraff quality, would it be the reason why they sell this tableware at such discounts? Really dissapointed"
1,Excellent Product for the Price,"This has been a hard item to find locally because of all the recent storm activity. Luckily Amazon had this in stock and at a competitive price. With regards to shipping I received the product just a few days after ordering it.I installed this at my father's house and it was quite simple (very DIY Friendly) and it took no more than three hours to install. I paired this with a B&S; 5500 watt generator and it operates really smoothly. The most complicated part, which was not really complicated, was balancing the loads. I highly recommend product for those to have the need to power a smaller house."
1,Great read,Just what the doctor ordered. An easy read for those with a desire for self healing and improvement. I highly recommend it.
0,"Decent book, but the justification was a bit much","The book was well written and captivating. However, the author's constant justification of what she was doing and constant putting down of those who disagreed with her hurt the book tremendously. I understand wanting to look good, but she carries it too far."
1,Beautiful sound,"I wanted chimes that sounded melodic and soft, and not atonal and tinny like some chimes can. This fit the bill. I'm surprised by how sturdy and large the whole thing is, for the price. If I have one complaint, it's that the whole setup gets lopsided rather easily. I have to straighten them up more frequently than I would like."
0,I am disappointed in the way they are packaged,I agree with the comments made by Brian B. I Love Lucy should be available in box sets like all the other series. I love the show but I am very unhappy that they are not available in box sets.
0,Diving into the crap,"These poems might as well have been the dictated sounds of gas bubbles coming up through the innards of a body dragged out of a lake. Rich is bitter, stale like old medical encyclopedias uprooted from their post in grandma's attic. If that's what you're into, have at it. Me, I'm not into mothball verse."
1,Another must have!,"It is true that this book has its weak points, but I have taken a modern physics course using this book, and I was enlightened and fascinated with the material this book is composed of. In fact, this book was an invaluable reference for a later course I took in physics, so it is surely a must have for reference. If you're a student preparing to continue with physics, this is a must have book. It'll help send you on your way."
1,An insightful autobiographical look,"Most of the reviews here are critical and misinformed. They appear to be written by disgruntled hisgh school students who have probably been assigned to read Lee's book as an effort to heighten their multi-cultural sensitivities. The kids miss the point. This is an excellent, sensitive novel about growing up in many worlds at once. Where ever Kai Ting is, is the wrong place, even home. His way of finding himself, finding a place, is through an unlikely venue, the local Y. There is a gritty truth thst comes off of every page here. Lee is exposing a great deal of his soul and, at the end, I felt part of his life. This was the first work of Lee's I read. My satisfaction with China Boy led me to the rest. He has much talent, a powerful voice and a sharp sense of humor... even when it hurts."
0,One of Van Damme's Worst Movies,"The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching."
0,Not what was promised,I ordered a new one this is not new and it has marks on the back cover and the top part of the book has like a page rip up top i ordered new i wish it looked new and i found this stuff on the side of the book idk what it is i am gonna have to buy goo gone...thanks....
0,RIDICULOUS,"Flimsy, throwaway and ultimately utterly forgetable. This ""song"" just reeks of novelty. It's like the bastard love child of MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli, and actually no better than either of them. If I am to believe all the hype surrounding this group they are the hottest thing going. It quite frankly makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore."
0,Not of much use.,Not near enough detail to really understand and be able to use the TI-84. At least as far as I'm concerned. Don't waste your money.
0,"Boring, but instigating","I think that PKD is the most fantastic sfi-fi writer I've ever read. Notwithstanding, after reading masterpieces from him such as Divine Invasion, UBIK and others, I must say that I was pretty disappointed with VALIS. First of all, the book's first 120 pages are extremely redundant, with a collection of loose thoughts splashed and repeated ad nauseam. The things only heat after Dick's friend Kevin takes him to see the movie Valis. If you can reach this part (and many people couldn't), you will get some PKD's flavor. Some very interesting points are posed by him, what provoked on me a lot of reflection about life, religion. After reaching the end of the book I kept the impression that something was still missing and that costed VALIS the third star."
1,Great Starter Knife Set,This is a great set of knives for beginers or someone who is slowly building a good collection of kitchen tools. I bought them about a year ago and have used them and loved them everyday. They feel really good in my hand and have done everything that I have asked them to do. They were a great purchase for a first knife set. I've moved up to a similar set from Farberware but these were and still are great knives. The kitchen shears are actually better than the ones that came with my new set of knives.

0,"Smarmy, Trite, Dated","There's nothing clever, insightful or entertaining about this novel. It's regurgitated College Republican pabulum that won't appeal to any intelligent person over the age of 22. The characters are two-dimensional cardboard cliches of DC reporters, lobbyists, and politicians along the lines of ""Bullworth."" Cynical adolescent smarm that will only intrigue those with the most rudimentary knowledge or education regarding politics."
1,GREAT MEAL FIRST TRY!,"My Weber Genesis Silver B Gas Grill arrived today, right on time. I opened the box and within a hour and half put it together myself. The instructions are easy to follow and few tools are required. Once together, I decided to rotisserrie my first chicken. After one hour, I checked the temp of the bird with the supplied meat thermometer. Its done! My first chicken was absolutely fabulous. I used a small drip pan with water, butter, beer and hickory smoke flavor below the bird during cooking. The meat melted in my mouth.Like others, I have purchased my share of cheap department store BBQ's and they all work well for a while. This grill is sturdy, built to last and very easy to use.I used to think my buddy was the BBQ expert. I found out he was using a weber genesis. It made him the expert! Buy one, they're great."
1,for those about to rock,"Surprisingly light weight. I expected a workout from heavy boots, but they're easy to wear. I like the level platform. The laces allow for a looser or snug fit."
1,A look at the belts & pulleys,"It's not easy to tell whether this book is written with the therapist, the client or someone else in mind but as a client I found it a fascinating and fairly accurate guide to much that I've experienced. If I had read it before experiencing psychotherapy, I'm not sure I would have understood, appreciated or respected it. Now, however, it's almost like examining the infrastructure of my house (""oh my! THAT's how it's held together!""). My only quibble is that the closing section of the book gets a bit mushy."
0,Painful....,"If I could give no stars or less I would for this movie. DON'T be fooled by the trailer or characters. This movie is AWFUL!! I just lost 75 min of my life that I will never be able to use. I feel that I should get some reward for enduring this torture. This movie could have been 30 minutes less and it might have had a chance. The first 30 minutes are good, but you can shut it off after that. Go for a walk or something. You'll be glad you did.But seriously, don't watch it."
1,interesting movie,Glad that I made the purchase of this movie. The plot is decent and the actors keep you waiting for their next move. I enjoyed the movie so well that I watched it 3 times on the first day that I had it.
0,Buyer beware,"Didn't MGM receive some flack about their ""Escape from New York"" DVD last year? You betcha. A lousy transfer and one theatrical trailer to constitute the ""Special Bonuses"". Last I heard, they stopped production of it out of embarrassment. I wish someone would raise a red flag about ""Eddie and the Cruisers"". MGM's DVD release of this movie is a rip-off (specifics below in another review). It makes you wonder just how many of their DVD's they're shortchanging everybody on without the buyer knowing it. The ""Cruisers"" movie is still wonderful to watch(I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it), I just hate being misled with my own money."
0,"GRE for dummies, fifth edition","Beware...althought this text is easy (and relatively painless) to read, the math section does NOT provide adequate preparation. Several types of questions found on the actual GRE are nowhere to be found in this supposedly comprehensive study guide. I was very disappointed when, after studying the math section religiously, I encountered problems on the GRE that I could have easily solved, had they been reviewed in the math section of the study guide. I would recommend using this guide in conjunction with another (possibly the ETS) study guide to prepare for the GRE."
1,"Sexy, Simple and it WORKS","I had seen this DVD many times while I was in stores.I was trying so hard to lose weight.I was taking an aerobics class, pilates, and yoga at the same time, but it seemed that none of that was working, it only made my muscles bulky, which doesn't look well on a female, it's supposed to make you thin.So I decided to try this out.I did this for 3 weeks, 5 days a week, and I definetley saw results!!My thighs got slimmer, my butt got smaller, and my waist, not to mention it showed me ways to move in which I never could have before.So, not only did I lose weight, see results, but in the process I learned to dance!In the video Carmen is very comfortable talking to you, you feel like a friend and not just someone she is instructing or bossing around, she is much more personable.I actually prefer her video to an actual aerobics class.After trying this I bought DVD's 2, 3, 4, 5, and even the new one "" In the bedroom"".I love it!! And my boyfriend loves it too ;)"
1,What Fun!,"My three year old will still play with this at times. My two year old girl has had a ball with this toy. They enjoy playing mailman and getting mail and sending mail. They enjoy all the pieces that click and move and so on.If you are like me and appreciate toys that are fairly quiet, easy to play with, fun and durable, this is a good toy to buy.It encourages both small and gross motor skills. It encourages creative play and imagination and exploration of the world.I would consider this toy well worth the money.Enjoy"
1,Tonny Harnnel debut,This is the Tonny's debut on TNT and shows exacltly why he stayed therte for over 20 years. Seven Seas is still as good today as it was then ans all tne other songs are great too. Must have for fans.
0,I really wanted to like this camera!!,"Likes:1. Nice saturated color (kind of over exag. but I like that)when camera does get a good shot2. good for outdoor great light shots BUT.....3. Use of AA Batteries and Life is pretty decent.4. Size of CameraMajor Dislikes:1. Very hard to get any shots without major blur.2. FORGET using this camera inside. The flash is horrible. Please don't bother with this camera inside. You will be very dissappointed. There is so much noise on indoor pictures.3. I have taken close to 600 pictures at the highest quality allowed on the camera. Of the 293 that turned out, the mega pixels never exceeded 2.29 mega pixels.4. Forget Cropping with this camera."
1,By far the BEST lopper for thick branches,"I've tried just about every type of lopper, and this one is by far the best. I've used them just about every day for the past 3 years. For heavy duty pruning they are fantastic. I even use them for limbing trees while I'm logging (it saves on gas and wear-and-tear on my chainsaw, and is much faster and safer).The patented gear design is what sets it apart. It allows for tremendous leverage (much more than even a compound lopper - which can be double the price, and being more complicated, less durable).I'm amazed more people don't know about these. I guess the simple, inexpensive design appears too good to be true."
0,NO TALENT WHATSOEVER! :(,"I'm sorry to say this, but N'sync has no talent whatsoever! I mean what is so good about them? Their looks? I mean, they don't even write their music! Or even play it! That's pretty sad. Now Hanson and The Moffatts, they WRITE AND PLAY AND SING their own music. How hard can that be? Plus, all their songs are alike and they are just the next Backstreet Boys. I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS CD IF I WERE YOU. UNLESS, YOU LIKE THE BACKSTREET BOYS (gag!)!!!~A NON-N'sync FanP.S. Look, N'sync fans, no hard feelings. Ok? :) I mean, this is a review. We can put our negative OR positive opinions about them! I mean, if you really liked them, you wouldn't care about what other people think..."
0,"The Good, Bad, and Ugly....","The Good - Graphics look sharp, lots of extra themed items that look good, fireworks, import your own music, ride your rides.The Bad - The controls are clumsy and seem backward especially if you have play RCT1 or RCT2, lots of the scenery walls and things do not line up mesh with each other, impossible to create a ride inside of a building.The Ugly - The terrain application is HORRIBLE, no more tunnel, no more rides or paths underground, the terrain is no longer broken up in grids that can be raised and lowered, no when you do that work it pulls all of the land and looks like crap.You will be diappointed in this game if you are expecting anything like RCT1 or RCT2, dont waste your money."
1,A Very Good Game.,"This is a very good game (but not as good as FF9). I think it is better than FF7 (I just can't get into it as mutch). The characters are cool, sory is cool, and the GFs are AWSOME! (Cactuar is my favorite.) I will give my ratings from 1.0-10.0. Graphics-9.5 Controll-10.0 Sound-9.5 Replay-9.0 TOTAL SCORE-9.5"
0,Did nothing,"Did absolutely nothing I took it for about a month spent about $50 on a month supply and did nothing. This useless Crap should be taken off the market, don't waste your hard earned money on this gimmic because most of the symptoms it is supposed to cure are mental. If you think it will work it will. Its all in your head. Believe me these are just expensive placebo's."
0,Not Free SF Reader,"The Last Battle does bring the return of some familiar characters from other books, in the form of a big old team-up.However, that is about all that is good about it, as the allegory shoveled into this gets really very groaningly tedious, even for a kid. Really pretty dull."
0,"Good Information, awful delivery",It does make Christians and are concern for many things in contempory society look stupid. The concerns he raises does need to be looked at by parents. For a few children these items may be a gateway to other problems. But a good watchful parent would see that. I certainly wish this book had not been published.
0,Born Twice,"I did not care for this book. Although the topic, a parent's feelings about living with a severely disabled child, is an interesting one, the author creates a character who is so selfish and self-centered that it's almost unbearable. Characters, like his mistress, appear, have a fit, and aren't mentioned again. I don't know why this book got such accolades in Italy. Nothing uplifting or enlightening here."
1,Best Baby Book Ever,"This is the bible of what you need to buy for your new baby. They are right on everything and I think they should change the name of the book because it's not just about bargains, it's about the safest things too -even if it might cost you a bit more. They cross check with consumer reports and have a website with updates. I thought it was invaluable. I tell everybody to buy it and buy it for others as a gift!"
1,Korn's best to Date,"Here is a little experiment : Buy this CD, listen to it five weeks than give it to your favorite classmate. Give it a week and the whole clique of your classmate will know the songs and sing them whether they are drunk or not. This is Korn's best to date, it rocks from the Beginning to End. You can nearly feel Jonathan's pain physically on songs like ""Blind"", ""Fagot"" or ""Daddy"". The ability of the guitar players shaffer and Brian and of david is amazing ( just listen to ""Ball Tongue"" ). The real big thing about this record is that it is absolutly original and sounds totally different from anything else since the day it was released. It has a similar impact like the debut of Rage against the Machine or Nirvana's Nevermind. By any means a must have and essential for everyone who likes Korn, ""New Metal"" ( now this word sucks ), or simply brilliant music!"
1,great stuff!!,"a fine cd of jumping xmas tunes. The upproar that caused them to pull the version of ""silent night"" was concern about that verse "" round young virgins, motherless child"". Oh well, sounds good to me!"
0,Don't support this writer by buying this piece of trash,"A friend recommended this book which I unfortunately bought. I feel sorry for people who think that this is ""writing."" The author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth. If you want to feel good, buy yourself a bottle of wine, not this book."
1,Bigger is Better,"This is my 3rd Presto Griddle, but 1st Tilt'n Drain Big. If you can't decide which to buy, go with this one. For the price difference you'd be nuts not to. Between deer hunting, pheasant hunting and fishing in Canada, I spend about 30 days a year cooking for at least 10 people a day plus cooking at home. It makes a difference. Heats up quickly and holds heat consistantly."
1,Worth Buying,"Though not without a sense of whimsy, This book (like all of Judith Merkle Riley's books) deals with a strong and interesting female lead character and tells her story well. The story is propelled partly by the political machinations so common to the time -- so if you simply cannot deal with politics, do not read this book. The politics are portrayed in saucy enough manner that I doubt anybody could find them dry or boring, and Ms. Riley lays them out in a clear manner. The interactions of a frence demoiselle, her eccentric aunt, Nostradamus, a war, a demon, and various assorted roaylty and sycophants combine in a very amusing and interesting manner."
1,"Sturdy, fun, low-impact walking","Have owned this machine for a couple of years and it has held up perfectly. Surprisingly sturdy and comfortable for the price. In addition to its cardio purpose, the smooth, low-impact motion is kind to sensitive knees, great for loosening up achy lower back and hips, and helpful for stretching. Have owned other exercise equipment but this is the one I actually use because it's more fun. Note: Although it folds for long-term storage, it's way too awkward for moving on a daily basis, so it really needs a place of its own."
0,Don't try this,"This collar arrived in the mail & I put in on my husky to go for a walk. I walked inside to get some water, & by the time I got back outside to my dog, he had torn the collar into tiny pieces & was chewing on them. This thing didn't even last an hour out of the box."
0,Wait for the paperback edition,"I'm a huge Brust fan, but this book disappoints. There really is no plot to speak of, and the stories (and characters) meander about. As for the narrator, Paarfi is boring at first, but as the plot fails to move along, his voice becomes more and more annoying. There are some interesting bits info about Morrolan and Sethra, but these small gems are not worth the price of a hardback."
1,"A little change of pace, a huge improvement","incubus has changed quite a bit from ""S.C.I.E.N.C.E"" to ""Make Yourself"" but the change is for the best. I truly enjoyed their earlier stuff but this album takes the cake. Buy this album and you won't be listening to much else for a while."
0,No more single-handle faucets for me,"After 2 years of normal use, our Moen single-handle kitchen faucet became increasingly sticky. Went to Home Depot and was given the plastic replacement cartridge exactly like the one shown above, free of charge.After watching the Youtube video and following the included repair instructions to a tee, I swivelled the cartridge back and forth using the included plastic repair tool and an adjustable wrench. Instead of loosening the cartridge, this action sheared off the plastic middle part of the cartridge and left the cartridge stuck in place. All I was able to pull out was the cartridge stem.Without the outrageously overpriced cartridge puller and being stuck with an inoperative kitchen faucet, I decided to replace the faucet with a Moen two-handle Adler 87412 faucet because it uses the same valves as our problem-free bathroom sink faucets.Needless to say, I'm done with single-handle faucets PERIOD!"

0,Gorgeous watch . . . for a GIANT!,"I initially purchased this watch as a birthday gift for my husband, but when I opened it up I couldn't believe my eyes -- it is HUGE!

I unfortunately had to return it and find another more appropriate option for my husband."
0,Drosnin Megalomania II,"If the first Bible Code book was bad, this one is even worse. I don't recommend it, unless you actually enjoy reading Drosnin's accounts of how he is using the Bible Code to save the world from atomic holocaust, prove that extraterrestials seeded earth with human DNA, and so on.Drosnin calls his critics ""silly,"" but his refusal to even read or understand what they've found about problems with the Bible Code is far worse than ""silly.""Have you ever typed the word ""generalization"" ?If so, congratulations! You've just created a ""hidden message"" with the word NAZI, using the same ELS technique Drosnin loves:geNerAliZatIon...P>It's in there, every single word an official Bible Code TM message.In fact, the last word, ""HOAX"", is STUPENDOUS by Bible Code standards, having a skip of just 7 letters....P>Sincerely,Dave ThomasPeralta, New Mexico USA"
1,Changed my mind along the way,"I had actually not watched the miniseries before I caught the first episode (via Internet), but when I saw :33 I knew I instantly liked the series. Then after catching up with the miniseries to get the background, I couldn't wait until I was able to obtain the remaining episodes one by one.I was originally of the camp of not messing with the original BSG (Starbuck a woman?, Tigh a drunk?, Boomer a Cylon?), so I boycotted the miniseries. Well, it's much better TV than most rewrites - thinking along the lines of what they did to Mission Impossible-Tom Cruise's version (yuck) and how I hate that."

1,Amazing Device,"I was worried about justifying the price, at first, but now I can't go anywhere without my Kindle. It is very portable, user friendly easy on the eyes. I have numerous of my favorite books on it and have downloaded the samples before deciding to buy other books. It's just as good as being at the bookstore and looking for that right book to purchase. I would like to see more of the other fiction come online to download and eventually I think that will happen. I will never carry another paperback with me again!"
0,totally unenjoyable,"I guess maybe I'm just some sort of peon. I loved phish, for years. I think Trey's solo debut in 2002 is incredible. I grock much of what Medeski does. I think Michael Ray's a genius, and consider myself fortunate to live in the same town he does so that I can hear him and his Cosmic Krewe often. I could go on and on about each of these musicians individually. But that's not what this album is about.Well, I don't know WHAT it is about. I suppose if I wasn't such a peon musically, I would *get* this album, understand it and appreciate its genius or whatever. But that's beside the point, because I'm not above admitting when I haven't got a freakin' clue. BUT BEYOND THAT, even if I could appreciate what these individually great musicians were trying to do here in the collective, I doubt I could ever ENJOY it. It's almost painful at points. I don't enjoy this kind of pain. This kind of pain is only a waste of money.oh well."

0,Not worth the money.,"Nice idea, but construction is really flimsy. So flimsy that one of the tiny nubs that holds on the front lid had broken off in the box prior to use. Also comes in that ugly beige desktop pc color. Note to Belkin, beef up the lid construction! This item is going back."
0,Pretentious trash,"As many other reviewers have said - oh that I would have heeded their warnings, this was (along with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time) the absolute worst book I've ever suffered through. I truly wished, every time I turned a page, that I was the type of person that could quit reading a book and just move on. Sadly I read the entire, wretched thing. Not only was the story utterly pointless and needlessly confusing, the writing style was pretentious and irritating. I found myself hating every character and thinking JSF must be very arrogant to imagine that people would gain anything (particularly ""illumination"") from this over-stylized yarn. Yuck."

The motor makes a rather loud and obnoxious sound as the tray advances; we moved the feeder into another part of the house rather than our adjoining bathroom: it helped but did not eliminate the noise. The electronic controller failed after just 13 months, locking the motor into a continuous ""advance"" mode. The controller also does not have any sort of memory back-up, requiring that the whole feeding sequence be reprogrammed whenever the 4 D-cell batteries are changed. And when we sent e-mails through the PetSafe Web site, asking for help with the failed controller, we never received a response.$50 is too much to pay for a product that barely makes it past a year."
1,Roberts Rules of Order,Good. Find that something are to much info for basic use. To use this book yoou must alsmot have to memorize it.
0,worst Marvel game ever,"If you are looking for a great Marvel game by Activison try Spiderman. This game is terrible. I rented this game, played through it, and I must say the plot and the character voices are amazing, but if it is gameplay you are looking for go somewhere else. In the comics and the movies, Wolverine has the power to heel from damage inflicted from the enemy, but in the game you have to go around looking for health bars. Automatic heeling would great, and very helpful in this game.Bottom line:Not worth renting, much less buying!"
0,Very disappointing,"I bought this book with such high hopes. By the time I forced myself to finish it, I was so disappointed. I had heard such wonderful things about The Secret Life of Bees. The ""love"" (I use that term very loosely) story was so poorly written and conceived -- very unbelievable and almost smarmy. I didn't like -- and therefore didn't care about -- the characters. I thought the overall story was a stretch. Sorry -- this one should be passed by. I can't believe it's been so highly acclaimed."
0,Your buying a mark off ~ it's fake!,I bought this dryer because Amazon was the only place it wasn't out of stock. When I rec'd it in the mail it looked nothing like the picture. I went on Bespoke Labs to sign up for the warranty & they said it was being sold through an unauthorized dealer. I spent the $300 for it. I shipped it back hoping they will credit my account. If I'm buying something that xpensive it better be the real thing. This dryer wasn't. I could tell because Bespoke's name was only found on the box...not the dryer at all. Highly disappointed that I fell for a fake! I know how to wait until the product become available at an authorized dealer. Bespoke Labs warranty on this dryer is 4 yrs. if you go on their site. Amazon's is only 60 days. Don't waste your $ or time. It's like buying a knock off Louis in New York City. Don't do it!
1,This is the only stuff that works for my mom' s feet,"I buy this for my elderly mom. She works on her feet all day and when she comes home she rubs the cool Sombra on her feet. She says it refreshes her feet and takes the soreness out. I am always looking for a deal so I think Amazon is the cheapest place to buy. And it seems to get to her real quick. This stuff is nice, not real greasy, rubs in and there is no strong smell."
0,eh,chris carabbas way to fame. worst dc cd. hes very overrated. just look at further seems forever. their new cd is better without them and much better than any dc cd. go buy how to start a fire by fsf insted.
1,VERY practical & immediately useful,"What a great book for leaders, husbands and wives, and friends. All of us have ""difficult people"" to deal with and this book is a winner in that area. It moves you from resignation to effectiveness.Not only does this book help you identify personalities with clear descriptions, it moves you to deal with them with scripts. I found this the most helpful part of the book.Most of us can identify types and their actions. But confronting and speaking in a way that they will respond to is difficult for most people. Of all the personality books I've read, this gave me more practical tools than any I've seen.Also the Summary and Take Action comments at the end of each chapter are outstanding. I could only wish every author were so thoughtful. It makes remembering and implementing easier. A great book for leaders, managers, husbands & wives, and friends."
0,"Michael Osbourne, you are no Gabriel Allon","Maybe its because I read this after reading 7 Gabriel Allon books back to back, but this earlier work of Silva's can't hold a candle to the newer series. Michael Osbourne is an adequate protaganist, but he pales in comparison to Gabriel. His wife is whiny, the intrigue only fair, and the descriptions and metaphors still on the brink of what they will become in ""The Kill Artist"" and those that follow."
0,Ho-Hum,"I'm disappointed too. There are just too many mid-tempo mellow rainy afternoon songs strung together. Nels tries to inject some lively guitar fills but it's not enough to get things going. Glenn must have been bored stiff recording this album.The band and all their personalities may have worked well together during the recording session, but the loss of any real conflict turned this album into a snoozer.I still miss Jay's rambling piano playing."
1,Hilarious,"Fluffy comes at ya in another DVD. This is one of those, at least for me, that you can watch over and over and still die laughing at his jokes."
1,Great album but not quite up to vinyl snuff,"This is one of my all time favorite albums. I would not not say the 180 gram vinyl edition is poor, but it was not on par with many others I have bought. The highs are not quuite where they should be and there is a bit more cracking than on my other 180 gram albums. However, it is still better than my cd and the song quality makes up for everything."
1,Reliable,"This makes a nice, clean print and is reasonably priced. I've been able to print around 120 or so pages from each cartridge, so I'm happy."
1,Origianl / Scary,This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if the supernatural really exists. Like some of the past great movies. Need I say more.
1,BEST- EVER VERSION OF ANTHEM,"This interpretation surpasses all others I have heard..not merely because of Whitney Houston's passionate rendition..but also because of the brilliant orchestration by John Clayton Jnr and the Florida Orchestra. Recording quality was patchy, but excusable at this outdoor venue.One quibble: the disc cover states that the anthem music was'public domain' suggesting it was from some unidentified folksource. Actuially (and ironically) it was composed by anEnglishman, John Stafford Smith....1750-1836 and was originally titled Anacreon In Heaven (Source: The Oxford Companion \to Music)."

1,Sony 8gb Micro Vault is impressive,"Hi, I have read several bad commentaries about this usb storage device on different websites and all I can say is I love mine !! It is not slow and I think anyone with half a brain would realize that even usb 2.0 h/s transfers will never be nicknamed lightning quick usb!! This tiny thing sure can hold a bunch of info and many mp3's even at 224k kbps. Like around a thousand at that high quality bitrate !! I never realized people are so impatient as to expect instant large file transfers out of any usb storage device !! For the low price you pay for one of these I think you will very content to own one of these miracles of science !!!"
0,Not good for tech companies,This is a good book but if you are a tech company do not buy it as it is designed for small traditional business's.
1,Ley Lines: Danny Sullivan,"In a controversial field this appears to be a well balanced review of the many theories advanced. Understandably the emphasis is on the (Celtic) British origins. References to the various interpretations of ley lines focus mainly on British ideas, emphasis being on trade routes and burial practices, with pro's & con's of the more outrageous. Limited attention is given to South American ideas, virtually none to USA & Eastern. It is well written and eminently readable. Many instances of Ley line patterns are given in an appendix."
0,By the Way......this album [stinks],"Very depressed!! Thats how I feel after listening to this CD. If this was the first time I ever heard the RHCPs then I would think that they were a pop sellout band. However, I remember the last 7 albums full of original, rock, rap, and funk. Nobody could play funk rock like the Chili Peppers. Now, I understand that they are almost 40, so I forgive them for not totally rocking out. Where are the funky riffs and rhymes? This album is completely flat and very boring. ""Under the bridge"" was a new direction for the Chili peppers, but they have tried to duplicate it on 12 of the 14 tracks on the Cd and failed miserably. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. This music is supposed to pump you up not mellow you out. At least, I have their last 7 albums."
0,broken,"This was a gift for my Grand daughter, opened the box and it was broken. Was able to repair it with the help of some glue, but I may suggest better packing. Apart from that, it's a nice high chair for the money."
1,Great Story Line,"There are not to many good 'gay' movies but this was a great one. It had good acting and a great story line. If you haven't seen it, pick it up and watch."
1,Lovely,"I must tell u this CD is great. As soon as I saw the movie I rushed out to bye it. I keep listening, because it's a very good record. Also the songs are placed in a good order, so that when u listen to it, it reminds u of the movie. Every teenager must have it!"
0,"One hit wonders, and deservedly so","I was completely blown away the first time I heard ""I Don't Mind"", and decades later I still love the song. I owned this album first time around, having run out to buy it as soon as I heard the single. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Nothing else on the album comes even remotely close to the beauty and pathos of that song. In fact, with the possible exceptions of ""Waiting for the Worm to Turn"" and ""Coma"" (the other track to feature the string quartet heard so prominently in ""I Don't Mind""), nothing else was even close to listenable for me.Your mileage may vary, of course, but I strongly encourage potential buyers to listen to the online samples rather than assuming that the album's other nine tracks will compare to its one big hit."
1,fun flashing ball,I received a green ball and the cats like to play with it on the hard wood floor. It is eventually going into the turbo scratcher...if I can get it away before the cats notice :)
0,Appalling Writing Style,I have just started to read these books to my 2 year old son and I am amazed at how badly written they are. The sentence construction is awkward and the grammar is appalling.
0,Warning Dell users,"I just received the delkin DDREADER-14 USB for smartmedia cards. It does not work with my dell 3800 running on win 2000. As you install the drivers, you'll get a blue screen crash and a memory dump. The customer service said that they have this problem and are currently trying to fix it. They may fix it in the future but for now i will have to return it."
0,Still do not have it!,A stone was missing when I opened the box. I mailed back to exchange and after a month I still do not have the ring.
1,Wow!,"""Sunk Witout a Sound"" is a real page turner, literate, suspenseful and gracefully written. It recalled my brief experience on a commercial raft several years ago. Why people choose to risk the mighty river's wrath remains a great mytery to this landlubber. After only 5 days in the cold depths of the black canyon, I couldn't wait to get out. What the hell was I thinking?Bessie Hyde's poignant little poems atop each chapter break my heart. I couldn't put this book down."
0,Interesting technology in this one but not paranormal,"Beautiful scenery but nothing paranormal in this one either. Just like my other two reviews, this is boring!! I would like to see this technology used with a real paranormal group not backyard ghost hunters. There is a definite connection with this group, cemetery's. It is interesting how the orbs only light up in front not all around like a self lighting orb should. I give this one two stars because of the interesting technology but nothing paranormal about this one either."
1,wonderful book,This is a great book for kids but parents will love it too. The artwork is incredible. Very retro-cool. And the story is very sweet. It's my favorite of all of my daughter's books.
1,Amazing for its price,"This camera has probably the best and more solid metallic case I've ever seen. The quality of the materials used is incredible for a medium range camera. The 2"" screen (huge) on the back is a little bit grainy, but it's very fast and with an high refresh rate. The software on the camera is pretty good, highly customizable, but as another user already pointed out, there is no way to change the shutter time. You MUST use a tripod if taking pictures during the night (if you're using bestshot and without the flash), and they're a little bit grainy too, but pictures taken during the day are just awesome (real 6MP); there is also the choice for taking ""widescreen"" pictures (3:2) and I love that!Besides the night pictures, this is a great camera and for its price, built quality, and overall features, I'd definitely raccomend it to everyone!"
1,Dennis back on form,"Passion Street is a cracking single from former Dr Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere. The close harmony backing vocals & Dennis's spoken intro instantly remind you of the ""old band"" while retaining a fresh, crisp sound. Well wort checking out (as is the album)."
0,Just coz he swears doesn't make him cool,"this guy is ... no words to describe the quality. This is utter s**t! Just because he is upset about something in his life or whatever (i agree with david, he has nothing to whine about, look at the starving millions of Rwanda!) doesn't mean complaining about it makes for good music."
1,Great Stanley tradition,"Great album with only a couple of minor low points. Not bad for a 2 CD set. You more than get your moneys worth... Ralph could have had a couple more musicians instead of show casing his son so much, but he is up front about it at least.If you are a Stanleys fan you will like this album.."
1,"ABBA WAS THE BEST, AND FRIDA HAD HER QUEST","You really have to be an ABBA fan to appreciate the voice of Frida. She continued on even after the group broke up, just like Agnetha did. Together, they sounded like Angels singing, and still were great by themselves on their solo careers. Of course, that's my opinion, and probably millions of other fans also! It's always hard to go on by yourself, especially when you have done so well with a legendary rock group. But things change unfortunately, and we have to make decisions, to either go on or to hang it up. I feel that when she made this album, ""Something's Going On"" it changed her style, somewhat, but not the voice of ""Frida""! I almost passed this one up, and am glad that I didn't! Great album."
1,Great!!,I Love this cd!!They are a great group of guys who are very talented. Even the singer lets just call him G-Funk hes HOTT!! Hes my favorite
0,Terrible device,"Over the years I have had several wireless notebook cards. The Belkin N1 card is the worst I have ever had. With my laptop on my lap in the living room about 15 feet from my Belkin N1 wireless router it gets only a fair signal and can't connect at full speed. 50 feet away in my home office it gets no signal at all. My older pre-N notebook card gets a very good signal in my office so this the one I use even though it can't take advantage of full N1 connection speeds. Don't buy the N1 wireless notebook card, the pre-N is a much better device."
1,Since I was a kid.,I've watched Pippi Longstocking (Animation) since I was seven years old. And recently I've misplaced the VHS video. I couldn't help myself but to buy it again! Its a great movie! Fun to watch! Makes me laugh and want pancakes! :]
1,16 Tracks from a Truly Gifted Individual,"""Seasons of the Heart"" is the followup to Jane Ellen's debut CD, ""From My Heart."" Happy to say, it's every bit as beautiful as the first CD. Even more amazing, the 16 tracks that are heard on this disc were composed specifically for the disc.For the most part, this is pure Jane Ellen, playing her own compositions as only she can play them. However, there's a bit more this time. A few tracks contain very appropriate effects and/or accompaniment. ""My Gipsy Heart"" is a standout example, and is a surefire winner.This is music as it should be--if you've never heard Jane Ellen play, then what are you waiting for? Buy without hesitation!"
0,disappointed,"When I found out Abena Abri-Let Booster Pads, Maxi, had been discontinued I contacted the vendor for a similar product. It was suggested I purchase the TopLine Booster Pad. In no way do these two items compare! Will continue to look and if anyone has an option please advise. Thanks!"
0,NOT HAPPY,I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS CD. NOT HAPPY.PERHAPS IF IT ARRIVED THEN MAYBE I COULD REVIEW IT THEN.MAYBE YOU COULD LET ME KNOW WHEN IT MAY ARRIVE.
0,"Poor Structure, Editing, but Good Info","If one has an interest in learning Sicilian, this book is a good toolbox of info. However, like any real toolbox, the tools are so cluttered and spread out that one needs to know what you're looking for and how to use it before he even opens it. There is no index in this book, and the table of contents merely has lesson titles (like ""At the Airport"") and doesn't tell one where to find grammatical info. One should not only KNOW another language before using this book, but one should know how to LEARN another language (parts of speech, &c.;) before diving in. If you know what you're looking for, it's altogether good.I don't know of any other Sicilian grammars, and thinking that this could be the best available in English frightens me. If I were a Sicilian, I'd be embarassed."
1,"I feel dumber, yet more knowledgeable","I really was not sure what to think of it before reading the book. I was disaapointed to find so much math, because I am terrible at math. But with so many different and obscure topics, I was so pleased with the overall content. Extremely thought provoking. Youll wish you could remember 1/10th of the book when you're finished with it."
0,Unless you've been there.,"If you haven't been to Italy, and you're not going, why read this tedious book? It is not for the light-hearted!"
1,Perfect playing,"Penderecki is mostly known for his symphonies but he also contributed a significant amount of chamber music including two masterful string quartets and two violin sonatas recorded for the first time by Ida Bieker and Nina Tickmann . The two sonatas were composed fifty years aapart the most recent in 2000.The first seems a very youthful but listenable. The second is meatier in terms of style and development of ideas. I consider it a masterpiece. It begins with an extended violin solo filled with pizzicatos and rubbing the bow against the bridge. It is astonishing beautul and dramatic from start to finish. This disc also includes miniatures and a quite moving capriccio for solo violin,Highly recommended for anyone interested in rarer modern chamber music"
1,Works and better than having cords,Works perfectly. Better than having those chargers with the cords. I just pop them in and out when the battery gets low.
0,Hella annoying,"I just don't see the big hellabaloo with dis album. They can play I guess but I long for the days when a band could not only play their instruments but write songs as well. Oh, one more gripe; the keyboards are a bit too sweet on occasion."
1,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time(Best Game In The World!),"Iam crazy about this game. When I first saw this game at [a rental outlet], I thought, ""Sounds like a dumb game"". But when I tried it, it was great! From then on Ocarina of Time was my favorite game in the world! ... Anyway, this game is action-packed, with tons of skulltulas and Ocarina Songs. ... It is sooo cool how you could choose kid Link or adult Link! I have not beat the game yet... but thanks to my players guide Iam almost there. By the way ZELDA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!..."
1,"Fun, Fun, Fun Game!","I had never heard of this game until my sister bought it for her family. I bought one for my family and we use it a lot. In addition to being fun, it is educational. Funny thing is, we invited Canadian neighbors to our house to play the game and they won! Even though many questions are US related, equally as many are historical or world geography. Great fun, which I would recommend for most any age."
1,Final review after using this properly !!,I read all the reviews before buying this case.The best thing about this is: the camera fits in properly with a little space for an additional set of batteries too.I would have preferred if it came with a neck strap but overall satisfied and there are no other better products in the market I feel.A worth buy for this awesome camera
1,Holiday Special!,"I am a huge Brian McKnight fanatic! This has to be one of the best Christmas albums I've heard! Even though the songs aren't traditional, they leave you with a real connection with the true meaning of Christmas. You won't get the warm fuzzies you normally get with the traditional Christmas albums. Instead, you get the heart wrenching tug that reminds you of why we really celebrate the holiday. If you haven't already added this to your collection, please do! You won't be disappointed! I would have to say ""It's all about Love"" performed with McKnight Jr would have to be my favorite."
0,This product didn't even last a day,"Horrible, this product worked the day we got it and then the next day it stopped working completely!Very disapointed"
0,A 100 Minute Dr. Pepper Commercial,"This movie was really bad. The victim deserved what she got, her husband was way more concerned with clearing his name than with his wife's death and the identity of the killer was obvious from the start. Three blatant Dr. Pepper product placements had me expecting the actors to break into song at any minute. ""I'm a Pepper, he's a Pepper, .... Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?""A full frontal nude shot of the victim diving into a pool as seen in a daydream sequence was totally unnecessary to the plot and obviously was included only for titillation.What a stinko movie."
0,Typical for-dummies format,"The book focuses on MySql and is a how-to for the commands and it's sql dialect. If you want to learn the concepts of Objects and Object Orientation, keep looking."
0,Yawn yawn yawn ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Diamond Dave is a crap album. This guy was only cool with 2 guitarists, Eddie VH and Steve Vai. As for this album, boring covers all the way through with a naff version of Icecream Man. All you can tell from this is that DLR has lost all direction. He couldn't get back with VH. Other musicians have dropped him. Perhaps it's time he retired. After all is getting old now."
1,Heed and read.,"This book rocks! The portrayal of evil is in the truest form that I have ever encountered in a fantasy novel. The exciting saga continues where 'Zorachus' left off. The heretic priest is now hell-bent on total self-annihilation. His beliefs call for him to repent, but his soul refuses to let him. His solution to his dilemma is to bring the Dark Lord into his body, destroying the world and himself with it. His old comrades are now his worst enemies and will stop at nothing to keep the obsessed priest from succeeding. The book keeps you riveted until the very end, but is it really the end? Read and find out for yourself. Then read 'The Blood of the Lamb trilogy'."
0,Why?,"This book is one of the most stupid once I read since a long time. It starts interesting - stays like this up to the middle and finishes horrible bad. It looks to me as if Bentley spent no longer then ten minutes thinking about the end and never figured out how he should end it.Sometimes through the book I had the feeling that Bentley knew that the ending is bad cause he let's his main characters ask themselves ""...how ridiculous this all is?"".Don't spent time and money on this one. Luckily I got my copy from the Library!- HolgerP.S.: Every King book is better!"

0,"Tried 2 units, both VERY LOUD","I was very much interested in getting some of these 'ultrasonic' bug repellers so I took a chance on this one. These things are worse than useless! I have no idea if it works on bugs, but it would sure as heck drive me out of the house if I didn't un-plug it immediately. Seriously, I tried two separate units in different outlets around the house, these things emit a horrific sound that was maddening."

1,mostly good,putting these gates up was not as easy as it should have been. the first one took me almost an hour but the second one took me barely fifteen. the one opens and closes very easy but the second one not so much. we use these in doorways rather than the stairs but for the price they work extrememly well. if we ever need more gates these will be the ones we buy
1,Great coffee maker,"Really works well...not really espresso, but works well, this used along with the Bialetti Moka Express makes a nice addition to my coffee bar..."

0,Description does not say how small it - really is,I bought these for my 12 and 10 year old grandsons - for the beach this summer. The description did not say exactly how small they were! They were way too small for their heads. Should have had in your supply and description - sizes: S _ M _ L!Very disappointed! Grammy M.
1,My Sisters Keeper,This is a very moving movie. You laugh and cry and it's a movie you can watch more than one time. It came in plenty of time to give o my daughter for Christmas. I love Amazon!
0,Not Stainless,"These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8"" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
0,It stunk.,"If this was my life I would be embarassed and certainly not put it all in a memoir. I would not recomend it to anyone. I don't care what the New York Times said, I think the book stunk."
1,The Thing That Should Not Be...,"The hideous idols have been found! The cult is gathering! CTHULHU is rising from the sea! If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, then you will love this 45 minute film version of one of his best short stories! Filmed as a 1920s-style silent, black and white movie, THE CALL OF CTHULHU: THE CELEBRATED STORY BY H.P. LOVECRAFT is a wonderful tribute to the author as well as his readers. The story is dark, the characters are doomed, and the GREAT OLD ONE is a stop-motion horror beyond all description! Highly recommended..."
0,Flimsy but great sound effects,"I saw this clock at a gift shop in St. Louis and had fun checking out the realistic drag racing sounds and the Christmas tree, but it is extremely flimsy and cheap. My assumption is that it would be broken in short order. I didn't make any attempt to set the alarm, but was happy to push the button to create the drag racing sound effects! Not sure the other patrons of the shop were as happy with the sound as I was."
0,Form over substance,"Form over substance! Dialogue is monotonous and sleep-inducing. Plot is not terribly intriguing. The only cool aspect is the ""cartoonization"" of the actors. Overall, go watch something else."
0,My entire book club disliked it!,"This book was so sappy. The people had no depth; there was no real character development. I didn't particularly care what happened to the people because I couldn't relate to them at all. The main male character was an adolescent girl fantasy come true. This book is just an overinflated short story, large print with wide margins. Its a quick read, so I guess that is one good thing about it!"
1,"Great Book, Good pictures, Best I've read on Sugar Gliders.",This is the best all round book I've read on Sugar Gliders. I think every new owner should read this book. The pictures are good. Several subjects were covered that I've not seen in any other books or WEB sites. This book is better then at least one I've read that's three times the cost.
0,This book doesn't even deserve a star....,"I'm sorry but I hate this book. It was horrible! I'm not a person that likes constant swearing so I guess that's one reason why I didn't like it very much. There was no climax to the book whatsoever, and barely a plot. I understand all the symbolism and I admit that it is great in this book, but I hate the book anway."
0,Not as good as expected,"I saw this movie with a group of friends, all of us expecting to laugh from start to finish. There were giggles here and there, and as college students, we enjoyed the excessive gore just as much as the scripted humor; however, it seemed the movie had so much potential to be funnier than it was. After the movie was over, I was glad that I brought friends in a sort of ""mysery loves company"" kind of way. Each of us thought the movie failed to produce the comedic value anticipated.The night before watching the movie, my friends and I rented ""Dawn of the Dead"" in order to understand any spoof-like jokes in ""Shaun."" And for that all I got was about 15 bucks down the drain, a few chuckles, and the experience of watching two below average zombie movies.The irony of ironies: I actually laughed just as much if not more during ""Dawn"" (a horror movie) as I did ""Shaun"" (a comedy).Final verdict: Go see ""Resident Evil."""
1,"Simple, refreshing, needed for most Christians!","This book is a great relief for many of us Christians who have been bogged down in all of the crazy things that other Christians say and expect. We all have problems, but some well-meaning Christians teach us that our problems are because we are not spiritual enough. Or they tell us that we just need to ""give them to God."" Or they say that we are selfish to get our needs met. Or they tell us just to leave the past behind. All of these cliches can be harmful and misleading.This book would be especially refreshing for someone who has been involved in a very legalistic or spirit-filled church. It shows that Christianity is not a quick-fix for our lives. And it shows that if we are to be honest, respectable people, we need to deal with our issues instead of running from them or stuffing them under the pews."

1,Money and time saver,"I received this machine well over a week ago and have made a couple of loaves and love it! It has made some delicious bread and is so easy, I am kicking myself for not buying this sooner! I bought bread flour and yeast in bulk and when we're almost out of bread, just pop in the ingredients and let the machine do the work. It's super easy to follow and will save time and money for sure.I have already recommended this machine to my friends and family and they're listening and purchasing!"
0,Redundant and Flat,"This is a book that I should have gotten through in 2 days. Yet after 2 weeks I still can't seem to care enough to finish. The subject of the Amber Room is interesting. But the writing and plot are predictable, repetitive and sophomoric at times. The characters are one-dimensional, and there are some odd mistakes that his editor should have caught. (Once inside the closed cave door, how *did* the character manage to redrape the outside chains as to make the entrance still appear locked from the outside? Was the rushing river hundreds of meters or hundreds of feet below the 3 story church veranda? Depends on which page you're on.)Yeah, petty, but I'd rather be scratching my head over am intriguing plot twist, but since there are none, I got bogged down in stuff like that."
1,Great Product!!,"My husband and I bought the 24"" Playmats for our nine month old because we have hard wood floors. We love the fact it has a thick cushion, and it cleans up easy. We like this product so much we are buying another one."
1,Because Of The Songs & The Year,"1945 was a very significant year in the history of the world, but certainly not for this movie. I was 10 years old & though my parents did not go to see this movie, the song, ""Don't Fence Me In"" was very popular & became engraved in my heart along with ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.""Since I grew up in southern CA, I saw many tumbling tumbleweeds & I am happy now to have finally seen the movie - even though it is not a particularely good movie I am giving it 4 stars just for sentimental reasons."
0,Wavy after 10 months,"We hung this screen in front of a wall of bookshelves in our living room, so we can pull it down when we want to watch a dvd or play Xbox with our projector. I love not having a TV be the focus of the living room.The screen was great at first, though the pull-down mechanism is a little finicky. However, after a few months, I noticed the screen had developed some slight vertical ripples, but they weren't affecting the picture. Now the screen has gotten so wavy, the picture is distorted. We're going to have to replace it with a higher quality screen."
1,Calm Before The Storm,The writer had a God given talent for the art of an author. She grabs you up out of the nice comfy chair you are sitting in and she hurls you into her writings. You have no choice but to ignore your surroundings and delve deep into the very souls of the characters.It was as if she knew our very desires and wishes that were deep in our souls where nobody had ever gone before. She dared to tap into that very being and take us to a place of desire and need. And then.... it ended. Making me wish there was an extension of the book. Whomever contracted with this author to write for them - needs many gold stars. She is AWESOME and I will continue to read her writings.

0,HP 6110 poses more problems than it's worth,"My husband and I purchased the scanner/fax/printer 6110 model in Feb. 2004 thinking it was a smart choice. Just call us dumb and dumber. The install on our Mac OSX system was a chore, and by May, the machine refused to send or accept faxes. Period. We were given a refurbished model that performed decently until Dec., 2004. Another refurbished model was sent to us in Jan. 2005 and by July 2005, it was dead again, this time suffering the fatal carriage jam that has haunted so many other former HP customers. The lesson here? Do your homework and beware this model."
0,"Warning, don't buy the HAP422","My last air purifier lasted 16 years, a HoneyWell; this one lasted 1 year then it just quit working, no power no nothing. Holmes/Sunbeam promptly sent me another unit which was a plus on them for the rapid response. But then the second one stopped working just shy of being 1 year old. This time Holmes/Sunbeam warranty serviced was horrific, it took 4 months to get a replacement sent after numerous emails and phone calls. Finally yesterday they apologized for the delay and were going to send out an upgraded model HAP424 for my troubles.The HAP422 seemed to filter the air good enough though not as good as the old HoneyWell, but way better then the Ionic Breeze which was a joke. Now time will tell if the HAP424 is just a glorified 422 and will last a year or so; but this time I won't have a warranty on it since replacements are only warrantied from the time of the ORIGINAL purchase not from the time of the warranty replacement. This one fries and I'll go back to HoneyWell."
1,A gem amongst Sci-Fi Channel movies!,"This movie is one of those rare gems to result from the SyFy Channel's movie making onslaught. Though the effects aren't much, and some of the acting is a bit cheesy, the movie's actually very good, overall. Unlike most werewolf movies, this one shows that a werewolf can be good or evil, depending on their own preferences and personality."
1,Excellent read,"With so many books out there on our mysterious antiquities and origins, Graham Hancock writes with passion and still maintains a level head. It's compelling and thought provoking without being sensational. Fun, smart stuff."
1,everything haba is fantastic,"i got this for my 1 year old, but she would have liked it sooner too. very graspable, fun to play with (what a great idea!), and with all that chewing still shows zero signs of wear. safe and non toxic, the perfect toy. very portable too!"

0,I didn't enjoy this,"When I tasted it, I immediately knew that this wasn't the halva I remember from my youth. I checked the ingredients and guess what; no honey - just corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oil ! Why is corn syrup in everything nowadays !I do not recommend this brand."
0,Days of blunder,"Watchable, but barely. Contrived inner torment. Baseless romance stolen from Top Gun. Not a believable premise. Don't waste ur time."
0,I used to like U2,"I'm giving this 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' cd one star because I don't like how the lead singer of U2 wears sunglasses all the time, even when he's inside. I think that's silly. He's very fashionable, I guess, but being fashionable is silly. And the other guy in the band, I believe he's the guitar player, I don't like either, because he's always wearing the same hat on his head, even when it's not cold out -- again, just to be fashionable.I do like their music though. The cd's pretty good. it's just hard to enjoy the music when you think the band's a joke.If I was just rating this cd's music and not the silly appearance of the band, I'd probably give it 3 stars."
1,An inspirational saga,"Andrews' THE TRAVELER'S GIFT reviews the seven decisions that lead to personal success, emphasizing and analyzing the difference between failure and success. David Ponder was a successful executive once, but feels like a total failure now: once an executive, he works a part-time, minimum-wage job and faces many crises. A life-threatening situation sends him on a journey of discovery in this inspirational saga."
1,"better price online, questionable gel according to my chiropractor. I would recommend.","Ive been told that gel isnt very stable if youre looking for support for your ankles and feet, however, these only have a small circle of gel in the middle of where your heel would go. They are comfortable, I would recommend but read up on the Gel in these products for sure."

0,A struggle...,"The book takes us into the world of Cayce Pollard, an advertising consultant, with the ability to judge an ad campaign or logo and determine if it will be successful. Pollard also has a strange phobia for certain product logos.The plot involves a fastination with the 'footage'. Small film clips which are being released on the internet by an unknown person(s). Pollard is enlisted to find the creator of the footage. This hunt takes her from London, to Japan, and finally to Russia.I found this book a bit of a struggle. The text rambled, at times, going no where. Some of the plot lines that were introduced were abandonded by the end of the book, leaving open ended questions. This was my first book by Gibson. If you haven't read any of Gibson's other works, I would not recommend starting with 'Pattern Recognition'."
1,Probably the best biography of Prophet Muhammad ever written,"This is probably the best biography of Prophet Muhammad ever written. A must-read, and must-have. Wonderful resource. I have read it more than once and yet it yields more each time - and so have found it to be a valuable gift to give to friends : a wonderful account of his life and the beginnings of Islam, and the inner and outer journeys, that is absorbing, simple and yet multi-levelled. Devoid of any kind of prejudice, an open and true book that is a pleasure to read, a tremendous learning experience for Muslims and non-Muslims, Easterners and Westerners, equally. Every home must have a copy !!"
0,Minimal at best,"I was very disappointed in this book, whose reputation has apparently been exaggerated. It was minimal information at best--nothing I couldn't have gotten from the FAQs section of the Harlequin website."
1,Awesome,"I just feel all warm and fuzzy inside whenever I sit down and the opening credits of ""The Office"" comes on. It's a great show."
0,This book is a major disappointment,"I bought this book with high, but nervous expectations. I was looking forward to seeing how this book had been ""revised and updated"" for the 21st century. What I found was a terrible hatchet and cut-and-paste job on Napoleon Hill's classic book. The editor, Arthur Pell, completely destroys the rhythm and flow of Dr. Hill's ideas by inserting contemporary examples at the end of Hill's chapters. It's a travesty. We don't need a ""21st century version"" of ""Think and Grow Rich."" The one that has worked so well all these many years is still the best. If someone wants to publish a 21st century book, they should simply write an entirely new one. Even minor revisions of a classic like ""Think and Grow Rich,"" to eliminate outdated language or correct errors, should be undertaken with the utmost care and respect for the original. When the project is over, it should still be Napoleon Hill's book."

0,"consider the source and motivation carefully, please...","The best advice regarding the written word is to carefully consider the source and motivation for writing it. With that in mind, one sees a steady flow of uninformed, sensational (yes, even malicious) attacks upon the Masons. They carefully ignore mentioning Christian leaders as Norman Vincent Peale, Methodist Bishop Carl Sanders, and the late president of Baylor University (Southern Baptist) Abner McCall- all 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Masons. It's ALL about portraying Masonry as a non-Christian (it's NEVER claimed to be Christian) or as some ""alternative religion"". My long held stance is that it's a handy way for these ""evangelists of ignorance"" to fill their coffers in the same way the National Enquirer does. The unwashed mob is still out there, watching TV and sending their hard-earned dollars in to ""ministers"" who probably know better than what they're saying, laughing all the way to the bank..."
1,Good...but not if you like dub music and if already own orange sets.,"As in the title if you have the orange box sets there really isn't any point of buying this. This isn't for people that like the Dub music because this box set only comes with eng Dub but Jap music. Don't get it if you already have the orange sets because the cropping is nowhere near as bad as people say in reviews and also, save your money for Kai. When Kai comes out in US it most certainly going to be released on Blu-ray. But other then that if you missed the orange box sets and like the jap music this is PERFECT for you."
1,Good but not as good as Lacuna Coil,"As with most others, I first heard Evanescence with the hit single ""Bring me to Life"". Surprisingly, given the amount of airplay this song has received of late, this is actually not one of the standout tracks on the band's debut album ""Fallen"" - songs such as ""Taking over me"", the second single ""Going Under"", and the beautiful ""My Immortal"" are far more memorable. While there is no disputing Evanescence's talent, they still have a long way to go before topping European rockers Lacuna Coil, who sound similar and yet seem to have that little bit extra skill, variety and depth in their albums."
0,Read WE instead,"This slender book (maybe emaciated would be a better word) is a meager re-hash of a few of the ideas that Evgeny Zamiyatin used -- brilliantly, incisively, and with far more vinegar and fire in his writing -- in his classic WE, which predates both BRAVE NEW WORLD and 1984. If you've already read ANTHEM, dig up WE and read that. For all of her vest-pocket nattering, Rand didn't have a tenth of the genuine creative power of Zamiyatin -- or his more genuine philosophic sense. ANTHEM is a bloodless, flabby little parable that gets blown clean out of the mind by the sinister power of WE.Zamiyatin died in exile -- he left the country rather than continue to endure censorship -- with his works censored by the Russian state apparatus and his legacy all but forgotten. Rand went on to found her own mini-empire of publishing and lecturing. Knowing Rand's thinking, she probably would have blamed him for it all."
1,"This is not the same Evereve that released ""Stormbirds""","After the somewhat disappointing release of ""Regret"", Evereve have undergone a almost complete make-over musically.....The music is heavier than ever, but with the inclusion of electronics that was hinted at with ""Regret""....Evereve have reached an amazing level of songwriting ability... The music captures you and doesn't let go.... very, very original..The songs are all well crafted, dark, and melodic... This will probably appeal to fans of Darkseed, Paradise Lost, Moonspell, or even early Stabbing Westward..."
0,"Heavy Duty Contractor Trash Bags ""Just as Good""","Space bags are cheaply made, if your not careful you'll rip the seams out of them, but even if you are careful the bag will not keep air out for very long. Air like water is nearly impossible to keep out of anything that it surrounds so if your looking for ""space saving"" get a box of Contractor's Heavy Duty Trash Bags and fold your items placing them into the bag, gather the bag around the vacuum cleaner hose, when the air is removed tie a knot in the bag. Like the Space Bag the air will leak back into the Contractor's bag but the knot and the seams will hold, you've gained space and it cost you about a quarter."
1,Great movie,Love the series and this a great addition. The action is good and the story line is great. A must see for Bourne fans. However if you haven't seen the other Bourne movies you won't even begin to understand this one.
1,Still a great read,"I read this about 8 yrs ago,found it in a used book store.I still think about it.A wonderful fish-eye view of a long journey with good and hard memories.The dynamics between father and sons juxtaposed with vibrant scenery make this a book you wont want to put down.Bravo!"
1,Not Your Average Urban Drama,"Girlz Night Out by Lucio Dutch is a fast-paced page turner with plenty of drama and unexpected turns!

0,Stop DRM!,"If someone want, nothing stops him from hacking the game, or downloading cracked version. I am buying software to support developers, not because I cannot download pirate version. But I will not deal (read support developers) with DRM! and such limitations!"
0,Disappointing,"This game was a huge disappointment for me. I loved the first Rogue Squadron on the N64 and still love and play Rogue Leader on my GC, but this game just had me disgusted. The levels all seem to rush you from one cinematic to the next. I know the medals all have strict time requirements but in Rebel Strike it felt like there wasn't any free time to explore or just have some fun shooting down Imperials. How are you supposed to get any of the upgrades? For me a game must first be fun and I didn't have any fun."
0,Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews here,"I can't for the life of me understand why so many people like this book so much. It's the worst piece ... I ever finished (Stephen King's It being the worst one I didn't bother finishing). If you know ANYthing about the Aztecs, you know that most of what happens in this book is absurd and stupid. There are so many better books, don't waste your money & time on this one. Go read Stephen King's The Stand."
0,Bad judgment!,"I enjoy this band tremendously live, but they made an EXTREMELY poor decision to use keyboards on their album instead of a piano. The very cheap synthesizer sound drags everything down with it and gives every song a feeling of modern poverty row. Guys, re-record this with a genuine piano!"
1,Excellent flow of the plot,"This is not, in my opinion, James Patterson's best book to date. However, it is a very entertaining and a pleasure to read.

Well worth reading, no-matter how much of an Alex Cross fan you are."

0,Incompatible with SDHC or 4GB CF cards though specs say otherwise,"I've had this card reader/hub for nearly a year. Until a month ago, it worked just fine. However, I've recently found that neither my 4GB Transcend SDHC card nor my 4GB Kingston 45X Elite Pro CF card is recognized. I wrote to i-Rocks to request replacement under warranty, and they tell me that I need to upgrade to a more recent card reader/hub. The more recent item (IR-8110) is not even listed on their website, and the specs for the IR-8000 clearly state that SDHC cards are supported.i-Rocks customer support refuses to acknowledge their error. This is the last time I'm going to buy one of their products."
1,This book made me love to read again!,"I was in the Book Den in Santa Barbara with my husband, looking for mystery novels for his grandmother. Carrie - a gifted librarian who works there looked at me - sizing me up - and said ""You should take this book, I think you'll really like it"". I was skeptical, I hadn't loved a book since ""The Outsiders"" in middle school, but my husband bought it for me anyway. I am now a converted book worm. This book made me love to read again!"
1,The best album of its ilk!,"As a former member of the band that recorded this album, I have to say that is just might be the album to change the way the world thinks about music. It's Rawsome!"

0,Not very good as time goes on,"The first 3 uses of this clipper worked well. Very easily to cut hair, cool to warm temperature of blade, looks good. After literally the 5th to present number of uses, the problems so far:1. The temperature of the blade becomes unbearably hot after about 15-20mins. It gets worst in the summer when its humid.2. The blade actually started to rust! Had to wipe off the rust repeatedly to remove it.I took care of this thing very well: oil blade before and after use, brush off hairs and cut hair only once a month.Conclusion: The bad reviews on this thing is true. I would not purchase this again or recommend anyone to buy this."
1,Fantasia the Great,"You don't have to be mathematically inclined to enjoy this collection, but it helps. On the other hand, if you take your math too seriously, this book may go right under your head. This anthology was first assembled in 1958, with some stories dating back to the 1920s, so some of the accounts of how machines could be used in the future now make one want to say, ""If only you knew"". Some of the best stories, however, are timeless. Section 2 (Imaginaries) is the best; my favorites are A Subway Named Moebius, And He Built a Crooked House, A Botts and the Moebius Strip, The Captured Cross-Section, and No-Sided Professor. A science-fiction writer friend once pooh-poohed this collection as amateurish sci-fi, but the rest of us will love it. It's great to have it back in print."
0,to basic for the advanced player,"Ok, this is fine if you don't know your theory very well. However if you do then no its to basic and predictable. If you fairly educated then do not buy this book. It's like many books out there. It takes basic ideas and drags them out to much. If you know your scales and modes then this book is a waste of time."
1,A Kind of Hush: Lightweight or Light Emitting?,"I've heard this performance and the song itself called lightweight and other disparaging things. I disagree. I find it a seductive and joyous song, evokative of the flirting of a young woman in her prime on a bright summers day. Its has the simplicity characteristic of all masterpieces, and is devoid of the pretentiousness and grand illusions that sophisticates admire and celebrate, as reflections of their own inflated self regard.As for the remarks about Death Metal that someone posted - I know that many of its greatest exponents are also among the greatest fans of Karen Carpenter themselves, which reveals the true ignorance of the individual who posted those remarks as an insult to her memory."
1,yuck!,This book is very interesting. It has [lots of descriptionsabout people -just what I needed to keep my attention. My favorite part [are allthe descriptions]. This book is interesting and you won't get it from your parents because they will be majorly grossed out... hopefully not YOU! I recommend this book to kids who don't like to read much because this one will keep you awake for weeks.
1,Very Good Entry Level Overview,"For beginners in marketing research, this book will give you a strong understanding of the basic approaches and the relative values of different strategies.The best value this book should provide are to people who believe that their business is doing market research by interviewing a few customers or conducting an occasional study. This book will clearly articulate the value and the errors that limited study can offer your business or group.Especially valuable to Product Managers, Sales People, and their managers."
0,What a ripp offf!!!!,"What a plastic piece of junk.Made in china, it is not anywhere close to water proof, just 2 sides pressed together, I'm afrain if it's dropped it will come apart ina bout a dozen pieces.The light is verrrrry dim, my small penligh is brighter with more throw.The radio is pure static.They don't include anykind of cell phone adaptor, rendering THAT useless, and the ye don't include a 6 volt input to quick charge.The ad is misleading the box is misleading.It's more suitable for my granson, i'm gonna trade him for his hasbro light evenup because the only thing that seem s to work onthis one is the cute flashing red light, and the obnoxious yet useless siren, he'll like that.but for serious use, this is dangerous to rely on.A total ripoff,it's not even worth the 9 $ shipping and I am going to refuse payment."

0,Not so great at all!,"People, the cable merely worked. It is well made and it did transmit the sound signal but the input signal was very low using a Shure SM-58 with a MacBook Pro 17"" mid 2010. If you need to record with a microphone, you'll need an external audio interface with a good mic preamp in order to plug the microphone to it. The preamp will increase the mic signal, and you'll be able to get a good sound signal in your recording application."

0,EA Sports. Get Out of The Game.,"EA Sports, purveyors of mediocrity for many years now, hit a new low. It's inconceivable that someone actually green-lighted this game with such glaring errors. To me a glitch is something minor that doesn't affect gameplay. To have released this game as it is...well, downright criminal, if you ask me. But hey, it's only 40 of your hard-earned dollars, right? And WHATEVER you do, don't buy it from GameStop or EB Games. No. As far as they're concerned, the game isn't defective. It's a problem for EA Sports, they just want to take your money. Well, guess what? Never buying another EA Sports game, and I'm damn sure never shopping at GameStop or EB Games. Why did I not shop Amazon in the first place?"
0,Oasis the Beatles wannabees,"OKAY let's state the obvious here: You don't have to be real hard core Beatles fan to notice how Beatlesque the band Oasis sounds. <Note to Noel Gallagher: you're full of it, man. You shouldn't call people nipples especially when they're the guitarist for the band you're trying to (miserably, I might add) copy off of.> This CD sounds like what a Beatles tribute band would sound like if they tried to write all original songs...it still has that strong Beatlesy vibe to it. This CD is a crappy, lame British Invasion revival attempt by a bunch of sad poseurs who can't find their own sound so they try and rip off of the one British band that started this whole thing. I don't like Oasis because of who they are and what they have publically said about one of my idols, and yes I know that personal opinions shouldn't affect the way I feel about their music, and so I'm rating this album 2 stars 'cause you gotta give these guys at least some props for trying."
0,Not funny,"I read a review that this book was funny. I laughed only once. I read in on vacation in the Bahamas. Not the best idea, a real downer. Too bad she's Canadian, I had high hopes."
1,Amazing...,"This is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of anime. I was blown away by this oustanding series. Its got everything, top-end animation, great music, deep storyline, comedy, robots coming out of peoples heads and then battling intensely. From the very first episode I saw, I knew it was the best show I have ever seen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and then a hundred more. I suggest buying it the nanosecond after you finish reading this."
1,Prometheus Rules!!,"Being a huge fan of the Alien series of movies, I could not wait to watch this. While I would have preferred a prequel, true to the Alien series, I was happy with the treatment and absolutely loved Noomi Rapace in her role. Something in the ending cost it the 5th star, I was not ""satisfied"" and would have preferred something different!!"
0,Disappointed,"I bought this book because the author's first book was helpful, and I was very disappointed. The book is not worth the money. The information is 2 years old and is all available on the internet. Save your money."
0,Certainly wholesome but.............,My seven year old boy didn't even make it to the end. He walked out of the theatre. Boring.
0,Would not buy,I would not leave these outside with the wind blowing. May keep car from rolling but I would not trust them too much. Cheap!
1,Very helpful for anyone working with kids,"This book was recommended to me by a peer before I started work with academy soccer players, and I have to say that it has proved to be very useful. I had previously worked solely with adults so some research was much needed. Don't be mislead by the colorful and childish cover as it has some great content - both scientific and practical.It is rare to find a science-based book that reads so well cover to cover, but is equally useful as a reference.There are opinions of certain topics such as strength training that could be argued, but then what good book doesn't challenge certain ideas or practices. It is of my belief that children's training is often an afterthought or merely based on adult models when in-fact kids are our future, and so we need to invest more research and effort into programming for them. Getting this book should certainly help you in this process."
1,"Management, Patton Style","Charles Province did an excellent job of compiling Patton's thoughts on leadership and how it applies to business. It brings a contrast between leadership and management concepts. He also linked the thoughts of Charles Deming to some of the messages. I have used selected points in sharing practical leadership and management principles with my business associates.Like any book, read it with a critical eye. Management and leadership studies are an evolutionary process. We should never stop learning.As an officer in the Army, I appreciate the candor of Patton and the book's focus on application. The messages are motivational. I would highly recommend the book as required reading and a forum for discussion."
1,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE,very few movies produced today or any other time in history for that matter has the inspiration and emotion as this movie does. in my humble opinion this film is one of the greatest movies of all time. this movie teaches us the value of never giving up under any circumstances no matter what the situation might be. ( dignity and humanity is worth fighting for ) JUST REMEMBER.....when you think that you have given absolutely everything that you have left to give to the point of human exhaustion always remember that there is always just a little bit more hidden away deep in you're soul to give and that little bit more in which i speak of is what we survive on.
1,DVD player,"The DVD player arrived promptly. The price and shipping charges were quite reasonable. In terms of functionality, it is easy to use and the quality of the picture and sound are excellent. I have only used rented DVDs thus far, so I can not speak of other formats. On rare occassion, it will get hung up on a DVD and one needs to unplug it and re-plug it in to get the DVD to eject. But after this it has always worked. I have only had it for a couple of months, so I can not speak about how long it will last."
1,Easy and Effective,"I started my 2 small goldfish out in a 2-gallon bowl without a filter and noticed that they were spending a lot of time at the surface gasping for oxygen. I moved them into this tank and they are doing great! They love the extra space and they never go to the surface for oxygen. The filter keeps the tank as clean as when I first set it up. Set-up is minimal and very easy. This tank is probably more ideal for a single beta fish or a few very small fish because my goldfish will eventually grow out of this tank and I will need a larger one. But for now, it works great.Just a note: I did initially have a problem with the filter being extrememly noisy, and the troubleshooting advice in the manual did nothing to help. However, I returned the tank to the store and received a brand new one, which has worked perfectly since I set it up!I highly recommend this tank!"
1,"Presto, chango, Magic is fun...WE'RE DEAD!","I saw this when I was 12 years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me - low on gore, high on psychological thrils, MAGIC is an old-school horror flick of the classic kind - anchored by Anthony Hopkin's early bravura dual performance as Corky/Fats - but what I remember most about MAGIC isn't the movie, but the scary as hell TV spots that used to run back in the 70s on late-night TV - the bonus materials explain that after the simple, yet very creepy TV ads ran ONCE on TV in New York, they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots - they're weren't far of the mark - as the camera pulls in and ""Fats"" intones his evil poem - ""Magic is fun...we're...DEAD!"" - you'll feel your blood turn to ice. A nice DVD to complete your horror collection - [...]"
1,Palace's best,"This is presumably not only the best Palace album, but also one of the best albums of the nineties. Produced by Steve Albini, Viva Last Blues offers you everything you always wanted. Mountain, New Partner, Brute Choir...brilliant songs with funny as well as personal-emotional lyrics! Check this out."
0,"Not vista compatible, contrary to write-up","The drive itself works fine, but the software/driver package is incompatible with vista. A new version of the writing software must be purchased in order to use this drive for bluray discs. I attempted to contact the company twice to get this issue resolved, but never received a response."
1,Enjoyable,"I got hooked on historical fiction after reading the Gore Vidal series. Citizen Washington wasn't quite as good in my opinion, but it was still engaging and very enjoyable. I liked the short narratives that still made us involved with every character.Could have used a little less battle scenes in the latter half of the book, but then I've never been a fan of them no matter where. Overall I highly enjoyed the book."
1,Nissan 18 oz travel mug,"After lots of research, I purchased (2) of these mugs. My husband & I are avid coffee drinkers. We do really like this tumbler. It keeps coffee hot for a long time. I also like that the lid screws on easily & you can flip it closed on the top incase you got it a little full, w/ stop & go traffic. It holds a decent amount of coffee & the rubber grip on it is nice too. The cup size it not odd shaped either, it fits a regular coffee holder in vehicles. The cup is not dishwasher safe, but I do put the lids thru the DW. Seems like these were on the expensive side but I think worth it, we have had lots of other coffee cups that dont keep stuff hot or are hard to get the lid on etc etc. I am pleased w/ our purchase!!"
1,"Nice, somethings could have been better in the movie but over all good for price",I choose this rating because I liked the twist in the movie & the ending and enjoyed seeing it in theaters.I do believe it could have been better I don’t know how or what I personally would have changed in the movie but something’s could have been funnier.I would recommend this to anyone it was cheap $4.99 for a Blu-Ray I don’t believe you could beat that price.
0,The Beatles?,"I loved Fashion Nugget, but Prolonging the Magic should be called ""MILKING THE FANS FOR ALL IT'S WORTH"". I thought this band had the most original sound to come along in a long time, UNTIL NOW! I hope they can find the sound they once had."
1,"People are weird, and this gem is great!!!","I have no idea why everyone's all mean to this Pacific Digital product. I mean, it's a pretty cheap price, but a good product for what ur paying. I refurbished a desktop, and added this DVD Burner, and it's been working fine ever since. I have no complaints whatsoever. I think the people who are whining about it should've paid more money for a better name-brand product. But, as I said, for the price, it's a good burner."
0,Not as good as other Star Wars books,"This book was VERY, VERY disappointing to me and the I've only read a few Star Wars Books. The book was difficult to understand in some parts and boring in others, with 1 or 2 exciting parts. I liked Rogue Squadron more than this, it was the only other X-wing book I read."
1,Great Buy for the Price,You can't go wrong with this item for the price compared to other models. I've had mine for about 3 mos. and been very satisified. If your looking for a decent model with easy to use features I would recommend this model. It does the job. I've heard APEX support service could be a problem but I've had no need for them. I would recommend the Memorex DVD-R & RW's. I've been pretty happy with the quality and able to play them on both my Sony and Panny DVD players.
0,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"You will read other reviews saying that the coffee maker would dump coffee all over the counters. I read them too thinking as another reviewer that it couldn't be that bad. Well it was. After six months of battling this beast, we finally put it to rest along with a $140 investment. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I wish that we had not."
1,Very useful,"I use it very often and it's very useful. I normally take it to the beach for my baby girl's items, so I can have hands free to carry something else. It's just a perfect size for me (I'm not tall at all)."
1,Review of How to Know Freshwater Algae,"This is a fantastic book for those interested in identifing algae to a Genus level. I work as an aquatic biologist for a private microbiological testing and consulting firm, and I use it everyday. The book offers very good discriptions and lots of helpful illustrations. The one thing I don't like about the book is that it fails to include size ranges of the organisms. I would highly advise anyone who deals with freshwater algae on a regular basis to pick up this book. It will definately come in handy!!"
0,"Crude, Inane, Poorly Acted, Boring","Even more importantly, it was so bad it was painful to watch. There's nothing clever, original or funny about it."
0,VERY BAD QUALITY!,I bought these as an extra to have lying around and was VERY disappointed at the quality. I wasn't expecting much for the price but the sound quality for these is VERY POOR! I plugged them into my MP3 player which was set at the volume that I like and sounds great on my Skullcandy earbuds but these sounded distorted and the bass was near nonexistant. I will stick to Skullcandy in the future....
1,Great Great Great!!!!,Am in love with Mad Men and have enjoyed every episode. Especially enjoyed commentary with every episode. Remembering the Cuban Missile crisis and how very close we came to nuclear war
0,Star Wars Blows it Away!,"The Matrix is one of the worst films in a long time. The dry, lifeless plot matches the dry, lifeless characters. Don't waste your time on this film. It's one of the most irrelevent ,pointless movies ever made. Instead people should turn to any of the 4 Star Wars films , the true Sci-fi epic the Matrix will never be."
0,Buyers Beware!,RCA does not stand behind is product! I bought an MP3 that they admit is DEFFECTIVE but they will charge me $62 for a replacement when I paid $59 for it at a local store! And no there products are NOT Vista compatible. They don't have any other alternative drivers or software for vista at this point. But I found a way around that to find out that the Mp3 player itself is deffective. Spent an hour on the phone with customer service and she told me I should send it back but I would have to pay more to replace it than I paid for it new! There customer service also informed me I wasn't the only one with these problems! STAY AWAY FROM RCA!!!! I had a similar thing happen some years ago with an rca VCR!
1,Elvis and a Great collection of his movies!,"I've always enjoyed seeing Elvis movies every so often and here is a superb collection. The conversion of the movies to DVD was good and seemed without any flaws. Each movie is pressed onto it's own individual DVD. 2 DVD movies per case, 4 cases and 8 movies. The velvet outer case is a nice touch.You can't go wrong with this collection. I wish they had another version with some of his other movies. After looking over all of the movies made by Elvis I didn't really realize he was churning them out that fast! I chose this collection too, because it has been many years that I have seen ANY of these movies from this collection."
0,GPU202 has problem with my Omnibook 6000,"The GPU2002 I bought doesn't work properly with my Omnibook 6000. The data in the external USB2 disk got lost. From the previous reviews, its performance seems to be a random thing, depending on the machine you have."
1,Maybe a bit too good =),"Let me make this clear - My boyfriend buys me these things not me. Mostly because if I allowed myself to buy them, I'd never eat anything else. Yeah. They're that good.They aren't dry and crumbly like most gluten-free goodies, but rather soft and chewy. They have a great real cherry flavor that my boyfriend loves (so he gets to eat most of them anyway). And since they're individually wrapped they are perfect to throw in a bag and take with you for a snack if you're going to be someplace where you don't know if you can get something to eat.The reason that I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is because as good as these taste, they still give me a tummy ache. I can handle one, but after that I think they are just a little too rich for me to handle. So eat with caution and maybe just learn to really enjoy one at a time."
1,Alice Clips,"They are what they say.. plain and simple, work fine. You can never have to many. Gave them four stars for being Made in Vietnam."
0,Very wobbly,The runount on these collets is terrible. I tried 3 of them and they're all bad. It's very noticeable with tall and heavy bits. I would expect much better from a company with a reputation like Porter Cable. It looks like their quality control has gone down the toilet.
0,What was the big deal?,"I bought the game, based on all the hype about H3 and H2 for Vista. It was OK, but frankly, HL, a game of the same era was more interesting. Maybe I am just jaded by the current generation of games such as HL2 EP2 or BioShock. In any case, OK for an older game, just don't pay much for it at this point in its existance."
1,Perfect for my needs,"I needed a cake pan to make 2"" cake balls for a billiards table birthday cake. None of the cake decorating sites had what I needed. I found this pan on Amazon and, after verifying that they had the best price, I ordered it. It was perfect for my cake needs. My customer was very happy with his cake!"
1,Great product for fat burn,"I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight (and succeeding). I've lost 20 lbs this month, but that's incorporating eating healthier (higher protein diet and organic food) and excersize. I drink one shake in the morning (I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk), and one after weight training. It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat, calories, and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain, e.g., Muscle Milk. Don't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up, and pack on the muscle. This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat."
0,One star is still too much,"I have read many bad books, but this one has the distinction of being the worst ever. It's disconcerting to see with what an impudence the authors pretend to write scientifically and at the same time present the reader with a hurredly-written stuff which looks like those school papers jumbled together late on Sunday. There isn't the least effort to deceive the reader as to the real aim of the book: to fatten the authors' bank account.The comments are such that a twelve-year old would be ashamed to make; the ""science"" is a downright sham; the ""test"" developed by the authors, and called MSCEIT, is in truth a DECEIT; and the authors are not so intelligent if they think anyone who read such a thing will ever buy another book by them.I leave the readers this last piece of advice: if you want to write an Emotionally Inflamed Review, then buy this book. Below there are a good many samples of the kind of thing you will soon be writing - and posting here."
0,Movie lovers-you can skip this book,"Before I purchased this book I read the two prior reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I found that if you enjoyed the movie on any level (cast, characters, actors, story-line), then forget purchasing this book. It has absolutely nothing to do with the movie in any way. They must have just liked the title and purchased the rights to it.I found the writing to be readable but not outstanding. The story unremarkable. None of the characters likeable or warm in any way with no real direction. If you want to read a modern day western, then Annie Proloux or Larry McMurtry or Tony Hillerman are far superior. This was a dissapointment."
0,"Ugly, tacky, pitiful","These are quite possibly the ugliest pearls I have ever seen. There was a deal and I thought, ""Eh. At that price ($4.50!! I should have KNOWN!) they'll be good for a little gift for someone - heck, I'll get two."" Boy, was I wrong. I would NEVER give these as a gift to ANYONE. Previous reviewer described them perfectly: orange, blemished, no clasp (though I couldn't manage that second star for them). Both sets are headed to my daughter's dress up box. I'm not sure even SHE will like them."
0,Poorly performing failure,"Do not buy this product. The very first time I tried to use it, it short-circuited and could not be used. I was overseas and left stranded with no ability to charge my cell phone or camera. I had to go out and hunt down another converterin a strange country. Worse yet, when I returned from my trip, the manufacturer refused to refund my money, saying it was longer than 30 days since my purchase."
0,Not a good book,"Not a good book. Difficult to follow, difficult to understand. It's fiction and not to be believed. Don't waste your time or money."
1,like jazz,This is like a jazz album. Think about it. Ignore A.A.'s voice through a few listens. Musicians -> Play the parts without the vocals a few times. Punk and jazz meet here for Ant. And if push does come to a shove and you don't like it try Tina Marie.
1,good enough for a costume,I ordered a size small and i'm 5'4 128 lbs and it fits pretty good. Like another review said the body is pretty small but I feel like if I would have gotten a medium it would have been too loose. The part that covers the boobs is much too small so i'm going to need to attach some sort of straps to keep it up. I'm using it for a poison ivy costume so its going to be covered in leaves anyway so its good enough for me.
1,I did try it out on email translations!,"Haven't been to Spain as yet, but will try it out in Tulum this October. It's been helpful in translating emails from Spanish penpals."
0,OK guide to DFT,"I read this book to help me study for my Ph.D. comprehensive exams. It is slightly outdated for this field (published in 1997), and I would not recommend someone to read this book. The topics in it are covered in more detail in other texts. As a proceedings of a summer school in theoretical physics, the level of math and physics is probably beyond most non-physics majors. This book is not suitable for someone who is learning DFT, which I find surprising since this book is from a summer school. This book is more suitable for experienced hands; people who have several years of DFT simulations under their belt."
1,Still pretty funny...,"I've been a life long ""Simpson's"" fan, and though this season isn't as good as the earlier ones, this season is still very watchable; most episodes are amusing, but some had me laughing out loud. This season was around the time I stopped watching it on television, so some of these I'm seeing for the first time. I would recommend this to any ""Simpson's"" fan."
0,Not worth buying -- even used.,"Low-brow as expected - given the cast - but with none of the satiric, ironic, or even pseudo-sociological value I've come to expect from viewing similar movies.This is a movie that apparently, distantly, dreams of somehow being camp, relevant or fun.Fail.Whatever the intention, this is a movie not worthy of time or money."
0,"Cynical, heartless slapdash quickie gets everything wrong","This film is bad on every way possible to be bad. It looks like it was shot in five days by people who'd never seen a film before and never read the book. It's obviously just a cheap riopoff designed to steal people's money. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. Plenty of ripoffs can be fun. Trancers was more fun than Blade Runner for me, but I'm not pretending it was better like some people are with this. This is just boring, goes on forever and doesn't care - as long as they've got three hours of something they can call War of the Worlds they can get on to DVD at the same time as the big movie, they don't care.Here's what they give you for your money: No love, no care, no fun. If you want to encourage the kind of people who make this kind of crap, fine, buy it. But they'll be laughing at your gullibility, promise you that."
1,Incredibly versatile iPod sound system,"This is by far the best and most versatile iPod sound system out of the many I have purchased. Let's start with it's looks first. It is sleek and modern in appearance with small removable cube speakers that are unobtrusive in any environment. You simply insert the iPod in the dock and move the two removable speakers anywhere within 150 feet of the base. The included remote will control your iPod and uses radiofrequency so you don't have to be in line of sight with the base unit. This means you can get rid of your outdoor speakers (unless there are birds nesting in them) and bring these babies outside along with your remote! Sound quality is excellent and fully charged speakers will supposedly work for 10 hours before needing to be returned to the charging base. Definitely worth the money for quality, looks, and versatility."
1,DEBT VIRUS,This book should be required reading. It is written so anyone can understand. There are things in this book that everyone should know. I believe we could change the world's debt problems not just USA's. Anyone who has anything to to with running a country needs this information.
0,Not pleased,"Was a little dissapointed in the product, not as big as it seems in the picture and not as high quality as some of the other attachments we have purchased."
0,I can't use it on my computer,"I can't use it on my computer, I didn't realize that when I bought it, but I have Windows 7."
0,Mixed Review,"A mix of rambling presumptuous points/stories and half stolen self-help/philosophical concepts, this book is too big, too long, too confusing, and promises way too much. This elitist and authoritarian book does make some good arguments that will attract many individuals seeking direction and purpose. Religious individuals with a strong sense of self and faith will find this book offensive and may think of it as abhorrently ""evil"". If you wanted a good self-help book, look elsewhere. If you want a different philosophical perspective of the world from an almost cultish anti-religious frame of mind, then this is a great book to SKIM."
1,Good product good price,"Full version of office, taking some getting used to but overall seems to bbe pretty good. The only complaint I have is the activation key it comes with does not work with the pre-installed trial versions...I had to put in the disk and install it to get it to work."
0,I 2nd the Motion: Like Listening to a Migraine Headache,"God-awful, repititive boring stuff. Just say ""NO.&quot"
1,This pillow is just what I was looking for,"If you want a firm pillow this is for you. I had a Niken pillow for about 10 years. It was my favorite, but it wore out. I looked to buy another, but they no longer made the style I liked and the new style that company makes now is different. I tried the isocool gusseted side sleeper and it is a quality product, but not perfect. This pillow took a little getting used to. It is firm, but the ""notch"" is really comfortable in the neck and shoulder area. I have a neck injury and this pillow really helps me to be comfortable while sleeping."
0,Non-stick. I don't think so.,"I received this pan as a Christmas gift. I finally got around to trying it out last night. I was pretty excited about it because I'd heard how great grilled pizza tastes. Unfortunatly I still don't know if that's true. My pizza stuck to the non-stick surface. As I was trying to pry the crust off the pan I noticed the non-stick surface had actually come off the pan and was stuck to my crust. Threw the pizza, pan and all, in the trash as I'm sure eating that wouldn't be good idea at all. I'll most likely continue to use the base for future pizzas but will purchase a stainless pan or pizza stone."
1,If you had to buy only one book this should be it!,"Jeffrey Gitomer has put together the most impactful resource on sales there is in the world. This book is filled with practical, real world easily transferred concepts. But the book and read it, study it and earn with it!Thanks Jeffrey!"
0,Why haven't they fixed this?,"My son got the Plan City car transporter for Christmas to go with the road system that Santa brought. I love Plan City and all the pieces of it, but this one frustrates my 2-1/2 year old. I completely agree with the two main complaints addressed by other reviewers, which are:1) the two pieces (the trailer and cab) come unhitched too easily. It allows for it to turn easily, but they come apart all the time. My son can put it back together now, but still, they should come up with a way to fix this.2) the door on the back has no way to ""lock"" upright, so it always flips down and the cars slide off. This is especially irritating with the road system that includes the bridge, because the car transporter cannot go uphill to cross the bridge - the cars slide right off! Duh. Again, seems like Plan Toys would have immediately realized this and fixed it, because it was immediately apparent to us!"
0,Mistery????,Why should I pay almost $30 on a unknown album? No samples in order to see do it is worth the money. Can not find any Information on this album -no where-So should we just trust in the Name Keith Sweat? Don't think so.After all even Keith don't seems to write anymore new songs. Once I may here a sample. I might spend my hard earned money on this Mistery album!!
0,Not impressed,"I bought for the first time and used it yesterday. I am not impressed at this point. I had 3 chipped nails this morning. I hadn't done anything except wash my hair. One post mentioned this is a top coat. (I know that top coats and base coats are different). I used 2 coats as a base, then 2 coats of an Orly polish and one coat as a topcoat. I will give it one more try as a topcoat only and see what happens. I had thought this was a nail strengthener/hardener, and those are used on the bare nail. If this doesn't adhere to the bare nail then it wouldn't do much as a strengthener."
1,"Great resource, well organized companion book","This is a fantastic companion book to an Organic Chemistry II course, flowing nicely from Klein's Organic Chemistry as a Second Language I. Honestly, this book proved to be invaluable to my success in Organic Chemistry II. I recommend that it is used as less of a reference guide and more as additional reading and study material that is read cover to cover.The only complaint that I have is the organization of this book: with only 8 chapters, each chapter is dense and lengthy."
1,"Low price, little problems, GREAT value","This is the first DVD I have ever bought, but my friends who had them all had their brands to suggest. I liked the Philips that my friend had, but it always seemed to act up. I decided on this one after comparing prices and reviews. I am not sorry I made that decision. VERY rarely, I will ahve slight skipping or freezing problems, but it is always very minor and does not detract from the movie at all. There are loads of features, the sights and sounds can't be beat, and this has been a dream player to own."
1,A little bit complicated,"I had a little trouble in elucidating this story, but was drawn in despite this. I found myself backing up a few times to try and sort out who was related to whom and how. Insurance agent Abe Holt (played by the talented Forest Whitaker) is an ace in finding a way to get out of paying death benefits and other insurance claims. Has he met his match when a sinister young man makes a car crash look like an accident? Abe is suspicious, but he's the only one in town who thinks the burnt body isn't Calvin, or that the wreck was staged. Uncovering the facts may get Abe in deeper than he'd ever intended. This is a good thriller that is a challenge to figure out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Perfect Pushup,Absolutely perfect. I bought this product for my husband and I must tell you that it works like a charm. His body has become even more well defined and well toned. There are just muscles in all the right places now. LOL.
1,Pure delight. You'll savor this one.,"WOW! I highly recommend this book. SO VERY romantic. I took a trip to France (in the pages of this novel--not for real) and fell in love with the Frenchman Adrien. This is not only a fun and entertaining read, but contains some deep issues that Claire has to deal with about herself and her lack of passion for life. It really makes you think about your own life and ways to change things so you can enjoy it more. I totally loved this book. I know, I repeat myself, but I'm serious. I loved it! To the very last page. It changed my view of some things. You'll see what I mean. And of course, since I have French blood in my veins, I appreciated the cultural piece. Did I mention that I could hear (in my mind) the man speaking in French, though he mostly spoke in English? Be ready to be laugh-out-loud entertained when you pick up this novel. You can FEEL the love and her longing for what she thinks she'll never have. :) You need to read this book. You'll be glad you did."
0,bulky wallet,"This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few' cards in it. The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards (which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added. Sorry to say, I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me."
1,A thick and good C++ book...,"This is only my opinions, of coures. I like this book very much. It is written by very very intelligent people, I think. All I can say is buy and read it. C++ is not an easy language. But be patient, you will get it."
1,Mother Yourself and Your Baby,"I first heard this CD when my daughter was two months old. One day my normally happy baby was inconsolable; you know the scene -- cranky baby, frazzled mother, the loop of tension that feeds on itself. I put the CD on and let the sounds wash over us.My baby quieted down almost immediately and snuggled into me as I rocked her. She listened to the first few songs attentively. The music mellowed her and she slowly, sweetly drifted off. I took a nap with a little angel in my arms. It was a wonderful bonding experience.Susie's lovely voice lulls babies to dreamland very peacefully --and calms moms also.Together we listen to Sleepy Eyes' sweet songs -- these aren't your typical overplayed lullabies -- and now my baby recognizes the tunes, which have become part of our beddy-bye routine.We received this CD as a gift and I highly recommend it. Buy it for yourself. Buy it for new parents. Buy it for the little one you love."
0,rating walkie talkies,We were very excited about these walkie talkies but after using them we were disappointed. Unless you are in direct line of the both walkie talkies they do not work. The girls never play with them and they play spy all the time.
0,Too LATE,Did not receive book in time. When I ordered it was supposed to come in 2-3 days but later I go an e-mail from Amazon with estimated date of December 11-14. I was not happy and I ordered from one of your competitors who I could actually talk to on the phone.
0,Don't waste your money.,"I liked the idea of a book that could give you life guidance based on the day you were born = an aspect of astrology. I know you ought to take this stuff with a grain of salt, but even then, this book is lacking.The text often contradicts what is already established by many when it comes to one's zodiac sign. It is informational in that it gives examples, descriptive words, and names of famous others with the same birthday.This is an amusing read, but a hit and miss when it comes to accuracy. I may sell mine or give it to a friend."
0,OMG! So tiny,Don't even know what you would fit in these bags. Definitely not any treats! Do not waste your money !
0,"With cheap speakers, you get what you pay for, beware","After reading some of the reviews I decided to buy the set of speakers, well, after hooking them up and listening for 5 minutes, they went into the trash can. These have to be some of the worse speakers I have ever heard, very tinny sound, no depth to the music at all. my iphone with the sound turned up and with no headphones connected to it sounds just as good, I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for and these speaker sound as cheap as the price I paid"
1,Seven albums strong.....,"This album is a must-have for any music lover who chooses to see past the blights of American Idol and Britney Spears. For new fans, the band often takes a couple listens but they are worth it. For old fans, get ready to rock with Carrie's stellar guitar and a Sonic Youth-esque jam on ""Let's Call it Love"".I have been a fan for about 6 years now and I can honestly say ""The Woods"" blows everything else out of the water. The lyrics have changed drastically from ""One Beat's"" overt (though justified) finger-flipping towards Bush. Instead, they come back with nuanced poetry that is far more venomous and subtle.""The Woods"" proves that Sleater-Kinney has that rare ability (ala Sonic Youth and Beck) to always sound like themselves whilst releasing dynamic new albums. Definitely worthy of the title ""Rock Album""."
0,One Sided and insensitive,"This book means well but when children are concerned meaning well isn't enough. The book treats parenting as though there are answers to all the questions. It offers quick solutions to serious problems such as sleeping through the night. It advises parents to let their infants ""cry it out"". While this solution may be a choice for some, the book offers no alternatives. Other issues such as breastfeeding is made to sound stressful. I found that while looking for support this book makes you feel like quitting is best. Parenting is hard work with no easy solutions. If you are a first time parent this book is not the best option. It encourages you to follow the book rather than trusting yourself as to what is best for your baby."
1,No better for the money,"You can buy a grill with more bells and whistles for the same price, but as compared to other grills, will you find something that cooks great AND will last as long for the money? I love cooking whole chickens on this grill, it cooks them tender and juicy EVERY time (Medium-OFF-Medium). My only complaint with the Webers are the [low cost] plastic wheels; not a big deal since I never move it, but they don't match the quality of everything about the product."
1,Works for me.,"I agree with the other comments that it is a light weight plastic. But that is what I like about it. When using a hand held router or sander the other heavy hoses tend to pull against you. I also like the hose because it is extra long. My shop vac hose is only about 6 feet. The 15' in this hose lets you move around the work piece with out having to lug the shop vac with you.I've used this hose for about 3 months now. I've even stepped on it a few times and have not had it collapse on me. Maybe my shop vac is not strong enough, but even then there is a flow control to reduce the suction in the hose.In my opinion this product is fine. Maybe after several more months or years of use these other folks comments will come true."
0,Small print and bad pictures,"This book is not very user friendly - the pictures are dark and/or blurry and font on the text is too small. Another infuriating thing is that the mechanical pictures are always a few pages away from the text that describes them forcing you to flip back and forth when reading. I like to take workshop manuals out to the garage when working and sometimes place them near the item I'm working but the page flipping just about made that a waste of time. Despite all the layout issues, the book still provides a good amount of technical information and has helped me through several repairs on my TR4a."
1,Classic Actors,"I saw this movie a long time ago on TV and am glad they finally put it on DVD. And although it is not one of the best movies it reflects the time period of the ""lost generation"" as chronicle by Hemingway and acted out by some of the best actors of our time. I bought the DVD to mostly see the performances of Errol Flynn and Eddie Albert who are really the best in this film. I gave it four stars as it comes up a little short as a great movie but nevertheless entertaining."
0,"In one word, 600 pages of corny","After reading all the rave reviews, I went out quickly to purchase this book. I became very disappointed when I realized this is the kind of writing that is found in Danielle Steele's novels (sorry, fans) where there are too many drippy people and drippy scenes and I found myself rolling my eyes. I also found the author made me feel stupid at times. I enjoyed the scenes where they were isolated together in the house though and stuck it out with the rest of the book because I wanted to find out who murdered Zack's wife. I would recommend reading some of LaVyrle Spencer's EARLIEST books if you're looking for good romance (her newer ones are beginning to take on the cornball effect, too)."
0,Box of Rip-Off,"You're better off finding a box, filling it with rocks, then take the money out of your wallet that you would have paid for this and light it on fire. At least when the money is gone you'll have a handy box of rocks. This is a Rip Off. Greed has produced an illusion of a product. I don't normally fall for this kind of Snake Oil, but it was in a reputable store and I wanted what it said it would do, and became blind to the fact that the company didn't advertise a location, telephone number, website, on the package, blah, blah, blah. All the reviews about blinking messages, not being able to read music on your computor, etc, I experienced with my first hour of trying to figure out if this pathetic box of junk could produce anything worth while. It did not. I wish I had the box of rocks. Zero Stars."
0,Could have been way better. What is it supposed to be?,"This book is the worst video-game based novel I have ever read. The autor limits himself to describing the onscreen action, never going any deeper in the story. He even fails to highlight some potentially dramatic events, such as the first encounter with a Boss. Most key puzzles are overlooked, especially near the end where help is the most crucial. My advice is to play the game and to buy the official Nintendo Power Strategy Guide."
1,excellent product,"has good spread and being able to take out of gear to move, plus choice of two speed makes it nice. has been a reliable way to water the lawn without having to move it around much and the stopper piece, it will stop in case a person gets busy and forgets it."
1,morphine foundation,this CD-as with all morphine cd's- needs to be listened to repetitively.It just grows and grows - more blues oriented than morphine but just as addictive. Sandman's lyrics and music are a direct link to beat generation and jazz/blues.Kool personified. A giant of a song writer- completely unique individual and a generous musician. we are lucky to have these recordings.
0,AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME,"Usually I Love Andrew Neiderman's work. However, this book borders on being unreadable. It was never even remotely interesting. It was a complete and utter disappointment and failure."
0,Bobby Heenan DVD,"Another WWE stinker!!!! No comments from the ""Brain"" himself, who was one of the funniest men in the history of wrestling. Barely any snippets of his comedy, just poorly done. I won't be wasting any more of my money on WWE dvds."
1,Man i love this product,"its only been a couple of times i have used this,and my hair is noticably healthy,soft and shiny ,believe me this is a miracle product,as i used to have very frizzy hair before ,work very well when you want to style your hair after wash.i plan to use it on my boyfriend as i see his hair line is thinning up!!"
1,A really helpful book,"I really love the way Gary Kurtz wrote his book. You will feel so much better after you read it. This man has a lot of faith. I think this is a funny coincidence, though. As I was looking through the other reviews I saw that The Soul of Your Pet has also been mentioned in one. I had just finished reading that one last night! It has a different style than Gary's and gives a lot evidence as well as hope. I sure hope a lot of people buy both books.I will say that I wish every clergyman had a copy of Cold Noses. They could help so many of their parishoners. I can't believe how many people think that animals don't go on after death. Even those who think they know the Bible don't seem to pay attention to what it says sometimes. Thank goodness for good books that point out what God has said to ease His children's pain!"
0,Kareoke Nightmare,"Hi! I Bought this Kareoke for X-mas with my 11 year old sister in mind. Thank God I decided to play with it before I gave it to her for Christmas. I was very Dissapointed because the sound quality is horrible. The volume is very low and you can barely here yourself through the microphone. The Monitor is even worst,You can barely see the lyrics. To make matters worst for me the monitor did'nt show any lyrics at all so I had to return it to the store. I rebought it thinking it had just been defected but NOpe! it's just no good. Well if you are interested in a CD player then maybe you can use it for that however you can find yourself a wayyyyyy better Cd player for a lot less money!!!!"
0,How Sad............,"I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': ""You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!"" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up......."
1,Rook Cards,Rook cards great shape except the cards in yellow were very hard to see because the color was to light. Had never seen any like them before.
1,You must have this reference book for bayonets !,This is a must have book for the military bayonet collector. Line drawings of hundreds of examples of bayonets from all over the world. Great to id unknown bayonets.

1,entertaining!,entertaining. humerous. interesting stories and good problem-solving. We enjoy the 1900 background (set up) for the story. Characters are fun and the acting is very good.
0,Anti-One Hand Bias!,"What does James Jensen have against the one-handed backhand? This shot has been used by some of the greatest players of all time! Does Roger Federer come to mind???? Also, what is with the shameless plug for his tennis tutor that looks like a music stand with some yarn hanging down for a tennis ball? It's not bad enough we've already shelled out 50 bucks to be convinced we need to switch to a two-handed backhand???? No Thank You James Jensen."
0,Junk,"If you're into innovative rap and want something else besides a few guys sitting in their bedroom with a drum machine, then don't buy this album. If you're like me and are into tight beats and wicked hooks like the kind Warren G and Dr. Dre serve up, check out Gospel Gangstaz instead. These guys are wannabees with sloppy ryhmes. OGG's is tight."
1,I'll Buy This As Many Times As It Takes,"You need this album to make all your other albums jealous. This album will make all your other music want to try harder. It will make the rest of your collection want to keep up, well, except for the ones that kind of limp off into the sunset because they realize that they truly do not belong on your rack. Save yourself some time and put this rightous work of art up where it belongs. Watch it scare off the wannabes, and then just rub your hands and giggle as you give your ears the candy they truly deserve!! Five stars, 'cause they don't hand out six - sigh -"
0,"Stylish and functional, but short-lived","The upsides: This is one of the few high-rise faucets I could find that wasn't absurdly, ostentatiously high. The extra height makes washing dishes much easier. The nozzle puts out a nicely diffused, almost frothy stream. It doesn't pull out or return quite as easily as other pull-outs I've installed, but it works, and the high-rise design makes the pull-out function less necessary. (Can't get my wife to push the nozzle all the way back in after she pulls it out, though.) The single control handle works very smoothly. It doesn't have spray, but it does have a nicely diffused stream.The downside: The internal seals gave out after about two years, pouring water into my under-sink cabinet. I couldn't find a way to replace the seals. So I bought a Price Pfister. Doesn't look as pretty, but it cost half as much and I bet it lasts 20 years."
1,Awesome series.,"The autumn series its just amazing,I first bought them in ebooks but it was so good thAt I had to buy the complete series in paperback.It's amazing how after so many books the author keeps you in suspense and doesn't get boring,this Moody guy it's really gifted."
0,Why did I bother?,"I kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters, but I never got around to it...I'm glad I didn't. This movie was really bad. Most of the scenes just didn't make any sense. The characters weren't likeable at all, I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan's character like, ""this house is alive, we're all gonna die"" and ""you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it"". Thats the kind of bad script that I'm talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects. I would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given. All and all...don't watch this movie."
1,this movie made me love gena rowlands,before seeing this movie i never knew who gena rowlands was(that was about 15 years ago) since then i have seen most of her film work and she is the lovliest actress since ingrid bergman.i really enjoyed this funny and realistic movie about 2 misfits looking for love. i especially loved the scene where seymor(cassel) cuts off his mustache! rowlands expression is priceless!
1,An adamantly recommended acquisition,"In Rules Of Civility For The 21st Century, Henry Wheelwright has assembled a compendium of two hundred rules of civility drawn from submission by some four million Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts across the country. The rules of conduct were sent in by boys for themselves and others after reflecting on the rules that President George Washington copied out for himself as a youth of 14. Also provided for the reader is a Civility Workshop addressing modern threats to civility and keys to character building and leadership. Line illustrations enhanced Rules Of Civility For The 21st Century, which is an adamantly recommended acquisition for every school and public library in every community in America."
0,Disappointing! Pinker did not try hard here.,"I was a psychology and biology major in college and am innately interested in brain research, so Pinker's thesis sounded fascinating. But the book is not; it is boring, and I could not finish it. Pinker wrote this very casually, it is not a rigorous study and does not cover really very much material. Instead, it is more a narrative, a transcript of Pinker thinking out loud. This is one of those occasions I really regretted the high cost of a hardback.A friend studied cognitive science (really a subfield of psych, with a lot of computer science mixed in) at MIT, so I passed the book along to him. He later confessed he became bored and put it away. His honesty about my mediocre gift confirmed my suspicions. This is not a good book, although it may entertain some who are new to the field. Even if you are new to psych, however, there are much better places to start."
0,Its BEAN flour,"I wish I could use this flour. I'm new to gluten free and didnt think of the issues ""bean flour"" could cause. The taste is fine and the banana bread recipe on the bag is wonderful UNTILL its digested. We all had horrible gas pains. I tried it in a couple of recipes but our systems just couldn't adjust. I had to throw the rest of the bag away."
1,sonic assault!,"These guys simply rock, constantly heavy it never lets down. I wouldn't say there's any massive variation of style within these tracks but it hasn't left my CD player for a long while so that can't be a bad thing. `Sweat of the Bud' is a particular favourite. The lyrics aren't important but the vocal style is damn cool, highly advised to industrial metal fans."
0,Die Trying... to finish this book!,"I'm female, so maybe this is just a guy's book. I always like a good hero, and Jack Reacher qualifies as such, but I certainly am not interested in paragraphs-long descriptions of the geophysicalities of bullets as they traverse through the atmosphere. This and other testosterone-laden information unfortunately comes well into the book, so I plowed through to the end. I couldn't suspend disbelief in order to believe that any human can discern the difference between 1.4 seconds and 2.1 seconds (as it relates to the time it takes for a bullet to travel). I believe it took me 3.7 seconds to scan through each page to a part that I could tolerate reading until the end of the book, which fell flat."
0,A lost opportunity,"A great premise, a bad show. This was given an opportunity to have a great main plot thread (like the aliens in x-files) and also the variety of threats appearing on each different episode. Plus, it would have filled an, unless I am mistaken, otherwise empty niche. But it failed. Why? Well, for sure its not because of lack of presence of the 2 main characters. It was bad directing and bad writing. Shame...."
1,Somewhat pleased,We enjoyed the movie but would like it better if it wasn't in widescreen format.Will it ever be produced not being in widescreen format?
1,CEV Holy Bible,This Bible is so easy to read and understand. I like the print and the hard cover. A great buy.I bought it as a gift for a person who likes this version.

0,People are Cardboard Figures,"The writing is great in spots, the action spots. But the intrigue and the political patter are almost juvenile. The author's research seems to be good. Maybe I was disappointed because it was published after we got Iraq in hand. It jarred me to read what the author thought would happen and to know that it was nothing like contemporary history. I'm fighting to finish it by flipping through the parts that make me want to regurgitate. Some stuff in it is really great. But I'm not sure I can finish the thing.Robert ArmstrongAlbuquerque NM"
0,Disappointing,"So many products make promises they don't keep. This is one of them. They say it's tough.Sorry, it's not tough at all!I started making chainmaille jewelry recently and needed the softer jaws on my pliers for the soft metals like aluminum and silver. I have to redip my pliers every week and then they are out of action for 24 hours becuase I let them dry for that length of time. The coating peels off after just a couple of days use. I even tried a friend's suggestion of double dipping but that didn't last either. I'm looking for something more permanent.Beware buying it online as the price is jacked up. It's half the cost from a craft store even with tax added."
0,Soap-Opery Tale - Unrealistic Characters,"The first 1/3 of this book was just fine. The characters were portrayed realistically, with subtle enough evidence that this family was not what it appeared to be. Then the characters-mostly the female ones took 360 degree turns that were so unrealistic they became laughable, or at least shake one's head vigorously. When I reached for this book at my Barnes and Noble, it literally was within arm's reach (it was on the highest shelf). Frankly, I wish is was unreachable, I might have found a better book that day."
1,Absolutely Priceless!,"First of all, the remote is a GODSEND. I can be across the room, and the mobile will stop, and I just press which composer I'd like my daughter to listen to, and it starts up again for another 15 minutes of music. The music is beautiful... MUCH better than all the others on the market. My daughter just ADORES this mobile to pieces. There's always something going on, and the colors are so bright and interesting! I would buy this again in less than a heartbeat and wouldn't recommend anything else!!! You won't EVER regret this one!"
1,Simply Adorable!,"This book has become one of my favorite books to read to all ages and gender since 1986. This story of a mother's love for her son through his growth process is delightful. It starts with a new mother rocking her new baby and singing him an enchanting song that will last in his mind forever. As he grows he seems to drive his mother crazy as he reaches each developmental stage. But when night falls and he is asleep she shares a loving moment with him by rocking and singing to him. I can never get to the end of the story without a crystal tear drop. This book is a great gift for mothers, fathers, daughters, and children. This is the number one book I give on birthdays and Mothers Day."

0,It doesn't work,I purchased this based on other reviews. What a disappointment!!!!!!!! The cd instillation didn't work so I contacted their award-winning support. Guess what??????? It STILL doesn't work. I guess I'll have to pay some tech person to try and figure things out. That of couse will be added to the cost of the router which will make it less a value than Cisco would have you believe. I can't understand why they can't make these things easier for the average Joe to connect and get running.
0,Not what I expected.,Was disappointed that the puppies were basically chunks of wood faintly resembling dogs...thought they might have more detail or finishing. Would probably pass had I known....
0,lousy quality,"I had this receiver for couple of days. The first day was fine and I was pretty happy with the sound quality. However when I was watching a movie in the second day, the sound all the sudden went dead. Then I tried to power cycle the unit, the unit came up and then automatically shut off within 5 seconds. Nothing can be done afterwards to revive it.Also just checked Harman's website, noticed they had removed this product from their current product list. So looks like it is so troublesome and they just discontinued it. Don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of crap."
1,Great movie,Great movie that you can watch over and over. Themed music fun and catchy. Dialogue for both kids and adults.
0,Broke in less than 2 months,"Updated review: This product broke after less than two months. Even with a new bulb, it won't work. I'd recommend selecting a different brand. What a waste of money. :(Initial review (5 stars, if it hadn't have broken): We bought this night-light for our 6-week old daughter's room, so we could keep it dark at night but have light for feeding and changing her. We've been very impressed! The 90-second time is great -- I can do a diaper change with two swipes of the foot. The sensor works wonderfully, and we have it plugged into a power surge so we can point the sensor and light in the direction away from the baby. It's not great at figuring out when it's daytime -- it sometimes comes on during the day -- but this doesn't bother me and I'll just unplug it if needed. You'll love it!"
1,You will feel a complex amount of emotions,I bought this book because of buzz surrounding the story. It is a story of girl who is dead and watches her family deal with her horrific death. I have passed this book on to friends and some can not get pass first few chapters and then others just love it. Be prepared to deal with some horrific images and maybe some peace about death.
0,its OK,I'm not sure if its because my daughter is only almost 4 months but the toys does not really hold her attention very well. She will look at it and touch it but it does not curb her from wanting me to pick her up. The suction has its good days and bad days. Usually when I wet the bottom before I put it on the highchair it sticks better.
0,grrr,"The colored flashes seemed like a fun idea, but I broke this camera within 10 minutes of removing it from its excessive packaging. I was trying to change the color filters, and the cap on the color wheel wouldn't stay on when I tried to replace it. And then the flash charge button broke and I gave up. Try the Lomographic Compact Automat 35MM instead. Holgas are fun too."
1,kick ass,"My only real complaint here is that the replay value of the game is non existent. I mean sure it's fun to replay but it's not like you don't know what's around the corner. For that reason I won't shell out my $50.00 for it. I'll wait and get a cheap used version down the road.That said, this game kicks ass! I loved it from my first kill. No, of course it's not GTA. It's not supposed to be! But it is every bit as fun. Yes I'd buy it and love it, just not new. I think these games are way friggin overpriced!"
0,unhappy,would not work and did not return my contact about product until a week later. then they just sent a return policy recommendation which did not help because i no longer had the package it was sent in.
1,Excellent Power Strip,"small, high quality and snug between your home entertainment center and the wall. enough for six components. Works as it should and has a $10.000 guarantee."
0,Major league Depression,"To start off, just a heads up, you can get this game at Best Buy for $19.99. Which I did. And i still feel ripped off. God what an awful game. If you set some settings say in Franchise mode, they will not be saved no matter how hard you try and will have to set them again everytime you play the game. As someone else said, the only good thing is the pitching. Oh awful awful batting camera. Its not so bad if you have a 42 inch plasma but if you have something like a regular 19 inch TV, you can't see squat. Awful fielding and fielding cam. Bad interface throughout. Truly a bad, bad game."
1,Robin Williams Design Workshop,"This book was very insightful. I am a desktop publishing professional and was looking for ideas for website design. This book enlightened me to the many considerations in designing for paper distribution versus web publishing. It asked questions on a number of design topics and based upon your expertise level, the author directed you to other references. The illustrations were great. I am going to purchase The Non-Designers Design Book and The Non-Designers Web Book by Robin Williams and John Tollett."
1,Family favorite,"This cd is one of my favorites for Christmas, I love the arrangements and these boys can really sing!!! O Holy Night is my avorite track on this CD"
1,Chinese language study,"This book has no ""frills"" with it. It is simply short readings in Chinese that have helpful vocabulary. I would not recommend it without a class or teacher but with a good teacher it is a very useful book."
0,Will not foam!,This is just a big bug sprayer! It will not foam! If you want a big bug sprayer buy this.
0,Rudimentary,This book is pretty basic and not worth the money. Lucier must be trying to make money on the book and not on in real estate. A real disappointment.
0,Skip this one...,"I registered for this because of the Carter's brand - and their reputation for quality. I got one as a shower gift and decided to wash it before the baby arrived. I snagged the side of it (putting a small hole in it) trying it on the mattress prior to use with my fingernail (which is not ragged at all), but decided to keep it. It went thru the wash fine, but after pulling it out of the dryer - which was set on low and full of other items from the wash (socks, towels, t-shirts) - I noticed that the plastic on the back had holes in it and the material on the sides had started to 'melt' together in bunches. I haven't even tried to fit it on the mattress, because it is going straight back to Babies R Us and another brand purchased. Perhaps not drying it at all would be ok, but sometimes that's just not an option."
1,I like it but...,. . . the display is too bright - even on the lowest dimmer setting. I use a peice of paper to cover it up. The radio is not digital but that is OK..it's sounds pretty good. The quality looks to be pretty good and the nature sounds are great! Overall? Keep looking...I wouldn't do it again. I gave it 3 stars not four!
1,Gallbladder issues solved!,"I was dealing with a lot of gallbladder pain, now as long as I take a capsule or two during a meal I will be pain/discomfort free!"
0,"Unfortunately, a luckluster performance...","There is little to say about this unfortunate recording, which like the 5th symphony by the same forces, lacks sensitivity andis poorly balanced. Usually the Chandos team get a wonderful balance, so it is quite strange that in this series the balance is so poor. Winds are quite far. Brass often dominates the strings in full orchestral passages. Sometimes intonation is questionable.A new version of the wonderful 8th symphony is still waiting to be made (unless I missed it).L.R.London, England"
0,Poor filtering,"This coffee press allows large amounts of coffee to pass by the screen. Thecontainer itself is well insulated and keeps the coffee fairly warm. It does notseem to matter what you do to vary the water amount, spin the screen, etc, there are always lots of grounds in the cup."
1,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, ""What is truth?"" and ""What/who is God?"" and ""Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?""There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once."
1,Watch Battery Kit,"The battery tools and kit are good. It comes with pretty much all the different types of batteries you would need. The CD it comes with also is very good and helps you with how to change the battery on different types of watches. The box it comes with, I could have done without. But everything else is great! It's a pretty complete kit."
0,Orientalism still survives !!,This book seems to carry forward the Orientalist tradition of writing to smear and not to educate. It also seems bizarre in light of current experiences in Europe where educated women are converting in large numbers to Islam and in Muslim countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh who have elected women as heads of states.
0,Italian Forrest Gump?,"Not only were the characters, story, and inconsistencies with the original Godfather enough to make this a preposterous read, the Forrest Gump quality to the tale added to it. This book puts the Corleones in the unlikely position of having their finger in every pie of history through the 50s and the 60s. The thinly veiled references to the Kennedy family, the Rat Pack and countless other ridiculous references made this book a real groaner. As a Tallahassee resident I really found the whole FSU thing a sorry attempt. The only thing that would have completed the sad attempt at literature would have been a scene where Bobby Bowden and everybody on the sidelines held up signs and yelled, ""Run, Fredo, Run!"" and have Fredo Corleone score the winning touchdown against Florida.This book is a stronzo on the sole of the shoes of the excellent legacy of Mario Puzo. Do yourself a favor and wipe it off the bottom of your shoe before going inside."
1,Love it!,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Thread of stories that overlap by the end. Honest, lovely characters that all face pregnancy in different ways. Heartbreaking, hilarious, and enjoyable. Definitely worth it."
0,All About Options,"McCafferty may be a trader, but he's no writer. The book is like a cascade of thoughts and knowledge with no organization. Here's a thought, if I want to learn about futures, I'll look for a book called ""All About Futures"". Poor math aside, instead of babbling on about Deltas and Offset strategies in the first chapter, how about telling me how to read a quote, and where to go to get them. The cover says ""The best software programs for hedging or speculating"". In fifteen pages of ""info"" he happens to mention ONE fairly specialized software program. After learning all of the fundamentals of Options and Options trading, I might find value in some of the points in this book, but by then I'm sure I will have found one with a much less confusing approach."
1,Burton's Best,Just to hear Sky Pilot in it's uninterrupted version is worth it. Great album! The Animals come alive again .Buy it

0,Where do you go from the Bottom?!,"People need to understand how much better music with feeling is. Jessica is so far detatched from real music its undefinable. Real muscians care about their music and their fans. DO NOT BUY INTO THIS! ...for you own good, really."
0,Slow and unreliable,"I have had this printer for almost four years now, and while it has saved my bacon on the road a number of times, it has also really let me down at some crucial moments. First, like a lot of older Canon printers, it is noisy and slow. It takes forever to get started on a page. But also like a lot of canons, when it is working right the output is beautiful.But you cannot count on finding ink cartridges for this printer on the road. It also has a weird and unpleasant ink cartridge system which includes two very different little trays, and three different kinds of tank.But what made me finally leave the thing in a hotel room was its tendency to get halfway through a print job and jam or inexplicably give an error signal. I have spent hours trying to get a clean copy of a single transparency. Very frustrating."
1,storage of screws,"stores everything in its place, the drawers are a little flimsy. if the unit had a backing on it i'm shall it will be great"
1,Recommended,This is a very good read. It speaks a lot about the relationships that develop (good and bad) as much as the war.
0,Windows 98 Incompatable!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this machine without realizing that it is not compatable with the original Windows 98. It worked fine for a couple weeks, but will no longer print properly. I have tried to correct this problem to no avail, I've even sent it back to Compaq!! On my third call to tech support, I was told that on one of the pages inside the manual it states that this is a ""Known issue"" and that I must have ""Windows 98 Second Edition"" for their product to work. This vital information should be prominatly noted in the advertising. I am very dissappointed!"
1,Excelent computer and small electronics maintenence tool,It's great for computer maintenance. The ability to blow air is one of the things I like the most; but the extra attachments have the ideal size for dealing with dusty small electronics. The price is just right in my opinion.
0,HELLO COULD PEOPLE PLEASE SHUT UP ABOUT WHAT DEATH METAL IS AND ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IS,"Hi there I'm huge death metal fan, I love it, but I also accept it for what it is...BRUTAL, PRIMITIVE MUSIC! and that's why I like it. It's not art or some sort avante garde or DaDa art form that were going to look back at hundred years from now with great awe. So everyone shut the F&$# UP! You either like it or you don't...that's the way it will always be. Some People are post-modern and some people are naturalistic. It's just that simple."
0,Lame.,"This game is jut awful. All of the songs are covers which stops the player from taking anything seriously. The ""dancing"" portion of the game is just a bunch of random Wii remote motions that you need to come up with to make the weird avatars move around and score points based on if you are on beat or not. There is no structure on how to dance. The singing part has poor pitch recognition (or maybe I'm just a bad singer :D ) and just isn't fun. Kind of a weird game... there are way more fun dancing games like Just Dance, and I suggest making better use of the shower to get your singing fix for the day."
1,I learned something new,"I have read alot of Silver Ravenwolfs books and I really enjoy her as an author, she has a very conversational style and throws in some humor, I love it when you can really feel the personality of the Author and hers really shines through in her books. I always passed this book up for some reason but some things happened that made me decide to read it and I am so glad I did. I have had what I beleive to be an Angelic experience but I really was never sure of it until I read this, now a whole new realm has opened up to me. I never would have been interested in reading about angels and their origins, I just assumed they were wholly a christian idea and so kind of dismissed them until I saw this. Good to know we have such powerful allies, and thanks Silver for once again expanding my knowledge. If you are even thinking about reading this book at least check out the sample, you'll be hooked!"
1,Fun for Toddlers,"My 2 year old son just loved watching the balls pop up and then retrieving them to put back in. My 4 year old daughter played along also. You have to push down the pump to get it to go, but he caught on fast and was doing it on his own. Fun toy for toddlers, I also purchased it for my nephew and a friend's son."
0,Nothing Unique and nothing interesting for most people,"The Book of Mormon has too many questions attached to it... Ifyou are a Mormon you will love this book, 99% of the rest of you shallfind it incredibly dull. Considering that the book repeatedly says itconsists of abridgements of ancient texts it is incredible it usessuch longwinded language. For example in the New Testament there is averse about God taking his children under his wings like a hen withchicks- in the Book of Mormon this is stretched out into severalrepeating verses. The language is a problem too. It is claimed thatthis book was written in 'reformed Egyptian' (a language unknown toall but Mormons), but why didn't these Jews use a kind of monumentalHebrew, Aramaic or Syraic? The translation is into 'Ye Olde English',Joseph Smith would have been better putting it into his own tongue. Hemakes mistakes such as talking about 'cherubims'- -im is a basicHebrew plural so it's like saying angelses!..."
1,for the toddler at heart,"I just downloaded these one day as they were so inexpensive for my 18-month old twins who were driving me crazy one breakfast... Much to my chagrin, they loved them SO much more than their many expensive, stylish, ""adult friendly"" CD's. There are many songs with animal sounds that they can make (""old Mcdonald"") or hand signs (the wheels on the bus is a big fav). And after a while, you will find yourself humming them too (I've sadly found myself humming fuzzy wuzzy at work...)These are simple, easy-to=sing, fun songs and they are what your toddlers want to hear. And there are 30 of them. What more could you want?"
1,Brings back memories,"This is like a teaser travel guide to Japan. It gives recommendations on where to go. This is ideal for someone who has the itch to travel to Japan and is planning a trip. I was happy to remember places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Miyajima, etc. Japan is a great place for sight seeing with beautiful architecture and nature. They do a good job of covering the country. I would have liked more attention to nature and less focus on technology. I wish it had more of a ""relaxation dvd"" feel to it. it is more of a medium paced narrated travel guide. Production could be better, but I'm still happy with it."
0,"Michael Kimmel is a pro-feminist , therefore has feminist agenda, don't trust his books","I have stumbled upon one of Michael Kimmel's articles regarding men's behaviors. I emailed him and asked some hard questions regarding his feministic attitudes. He could not answer any of my questions. For example, I asked him why he is so focusd on ""correcting"" men's behaviors when society and feminists and many women today view men as doofus, murderers, rapists, etc, as evidence by movies, commericals, TVs... Basically men are not respected while at the same time, women only programs are popping up all the time! Furthermore, I commented that in order to finetune men's ""bad behaviors"", one must also addresses women's attitudes toward men! He failed to answer and only ask me to be openminded and attend one of the women's courses and called me angry!"
0,Missing a few essentials IMHO,"Temp review for the quick read I did as I just sold the book:Well written for the most part, easy to follow.Negatives:Federal Reserve Act relegated to one sentence. The nefarious legislation of 1913 affected this country in so many ways, it deserves at least a page.The CFR (Council on Foreign Relations is not even mentioned) Inasmuch as the majority of our 'leaders' in this government are members of this secretive society I assert it also deserves at least, one page.Why do authors continue to relegate footnotes to some distant part of the book, thereby aggravating readers to no end ?Holy Alliance ? This term is used without defining what he means.Possibly in the next edtion the author might add a bit of discussion about how corporations, foundations, associations and the shadow govt play a part in our 'foreign policy'.all for now"
0,Horrors fans only,"Occasionally I watch a gross-out horror movie, if I like the actor and it has high reviews. I tend to forget that the high reviews always come from horror fans.And I have yet to see such a movie that was really good by ordinary film standards. This is no exception. Basically the story and logic is sacrificed for cheap horror effects, like maggot-eaten faces.The one good thing about it is Jennifer Connelly, who even at this tender age was the prettiest thing on two legs."
0,Some Came Running,"Another lumbering Jones' book that takes the reader on a tortuous journey through the lives of unfortunates while attempting to illuminate the lasting mental and emotional effects of war. Amazingly, all of Jones' books made it to the big screen (except Whistle), and in all cases the screen writing adaptations were far superior to Jones' original projects. By far the best screen adaptation was The Thin Red Line, which, fortunately, can't even be recognized as being inspired by Jones' laborious novel."
1,For theremin fans,"For theremin fans and the rest of us too. It is different, yet mainstream. Great for background music and a conversation piece ta-boot."
1,Great for Portability,"I bought this canoe recently and have tried it on the water. Its a fantastic canoe for people without an ability to transport a regular canoe.Plusses:1. Fantastic portability.2. Inflates quickly and easily. Really does take 10 mins or less.3. Light - easy to get into/out of the water4. Sturdy - felt very comfortable and secureMinuses:1. Is VERY difficult to get back into the bag. Suggestion: buy a bigger bag.2. Requires Kayak Paddles - canoe paddles too long. (Not a minus, really - just good to know. Its shaped like a canoe but sits more like a kayak.)Overall - well worth the price and a great alternative to a traditional canoe."
0,Beeps when power out and on battery backup,"I can't say whether it's good at sensing CO, but this thing beeps when it is using backup battery (even with a fresh battery). Power goes out? This will beep all night. After the third power outage and removing the battery a few Summers ago, we just never plugged it back in. Also, it's big and heavy and requires a tight wall outlet to keep it from falling out and on the floor."
1,Great support,"I was having wrist problems, so I got this mousepad. It supports my wrist as I use the mouse. It is comfortable. It did take me about an hour to get used to it. Now I have used it for several days and my wrist feels much better. It's a keeper for me."
1,Good movie....,"PU-239 is a relativately unknown movie. I came across the preview on some other movie a few months back and was intrigued by it.The other reviews have summed up the plot pretty well, so I won't bore you with more of that.PU-239 is a dark suspense Russian gangster movie, with alot of comedy mixed in. The acting in the movie is pretty good, considering the mostly unknown cast.A great dvd to check out if your looking for someting a little out of the ordinary!Highly recommended!"
1,Good coming of age book,"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade and I've loved it ever since. It was easy for me to relate to because Tracy was around the same age as me and I too had started to become interested in boys . Since then, I've always re-read Flyy Girl at least once a year, now at age 21, I appreciate it so much more. Omar Tyree did an EXCELLENT job of capturing a young girl's emotions, fleeting romances, domineering parents, etc. He transports you to the 80's, even though I wasn't born until the end of the decade I can imagine that's it's just as Omar describes lol I recommend that everyone read this book, its written before ""black"" fiction became over-sexual."
0,audio quality is poor,"I don't like this CD because the Piano is recorded in a very bad way (sorry for my poor english): no high frequencies, no low frequencies... BAD.And the sweetnes of this music is so distant from energy you can feel on ""La Scala"" or ""Koln Concert"" or ""Spheres"" or many other marvellous Jarrett's CD."
1,Love the Book,"Both my 13 year old son and I thoroughly enjoy reading Squids Will Be Squids, but I feel that the book should be geared for a higher age range. Four year olds may enjoy the illustrations, but they will not appreciate the irony at all. And young adults well into their teens and adulthood may find this book very humorous and intelligent. I certainly did. I enjoy it every time I read it."
1,Glad I had them,"I was introduced to these at the hospital after the delivery of my daughter. I was really glad I had them. I was worried I would run out of the stack from the hospital so I ordered more. I did not need all 100, but I had a couple pregnant friends and gave them the rest.I would recommend trying them."
0,Not up to expectatons.,"As a huge Barbara Michaels fan, I was thrilled when a new book hit the markets. The basic premise of bringing together mystery/supernatural experts in a turn of the century environment is wonderful. However, the remainder of the book is nothing more than a rehashing of old tales. Not enough advantage was taken of the original premise and it would have been far more interesting to use newly created mysterious occult tales and involve the legendary solvers more directly. I was very disappointed in this book but have high hopes that Ms. Michaels' next book will be more up to the standards of previous novels such as ""Ammie Come Home"" and ""To Be Buried in the Rain""."
1,The Lady's Tutor,"I just loved this book. Robin Schone is a great writer. I especially loved how the heroine realized the hero was for her and she forsake all she had to be with him. She gave up everything to be with him, even though he wasn't what her mother wanted for her. It was a very well written book."
1,Pachelbel: Forever by the sea,This is great for night time and to help my kids sleep. I love it and it is very relaxing.
1,Excellent book for those who want to learn good design!,"This is a really good book if you want to learn how to design in java. It's not about java syntax, not about how polymorphism works, etc. It's an introduction to design. This book will get you reading the gof book and get you started on patterns. I read chapter 3 first, then chapters 1, 2 & 4. It's a really good book. I don't understand why others gave it a 1. Perhaps those who gave it a 1 are the those that are still struggling with simple java syntax. This is definitely not for them.I just got my Java Programmer certification from Sun. I'm now working on my Java Developer certification, the examples given on this book (Charlie's Charters) are similar to the software project that I downloaded from Sun. This book got me started on how I should design the software project.It really, really, really helps a lot especially if you're working on Sun's Java Developer certification."
1,Will Smith Flies High,"This movie is an excellent vehicle for special effects and Will Smith-style comedic heroism. It is a good blend of action and science fiction with enough humor thrown in to keep it entertaining after many viewings.The story is fairly simple; the outcome predictable. Still, the action scenes help tie it all together in a neat, slick package. This isn't ""film"" but it is entertaining and destined to be a standard in the video collections of many a movie buff."
1,excellent - exceeded expectations,"Great resource. Biblically accurate and a very helpful resource for anyone who is considering taking Greek, or someone like me attempting to get a basic grasp on the NT Greek. The literal translation is printed in English directly under each greek word for easy understanding."
1,picture,"every thing went perfectly, thanks. I was fully satisfied. Got the things very quickly according to the distance to Germany"
1,I recommend this book to anyone who owns a home,"This is the first book I have seen that clearly describes the many ways one can use home equity as a source of retirement income. With Social Security diminishing in importance, shrinking corporate pension plans, and a volatile stock market, using one's home as an investment can be the cornerstone of a comfortable retirement for many Americans. The authors provide very practical ways for using home equity to enhance retirement, including: renting, selling high and moving to other ""value"" areas, private annuity trusts, interfamily loans, and sales and reverse mortgages. I like that the authors have invested successfully in residential real estate themselves and that they have advised clients on many of the strategies described in the book. This book is a winner with timeless strategies and loads of advice."
0,"Hulkamania's running sorta wild, but not really....","This was an entertaining book, sure, but it really doesn't tell the reader all that much about Hulk Hogan or the Wrestling industry that you couldn't find elsewhere. Hogan seems to tell a great anecdote, but skimps on details. Rowdy Roddy Piper is only mentioned once, although the Hogan-Piper feud was HUGE back in the day. Macho Man Randy Savage is written off as a ""Horse's bum,"" but never does ""the Hulkster"" explain why he felt that way. Other wrestling icons who helped get Hogan over with the people don't even get mentioned. The book is random, unfocused, and short changes all the people who helped make Hulk Hogan into the legendary performer he is today. It's like a bunch of unconnected incidents put into Hulkalogical order and printed with BIG pictures."
0,STILL NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.,This Canon PSC-60 Deluxe Case is just good to hold my newly-purchased Canon A560. I did not notice there is a shortcoming to this case until it happens. The front bag used for holding batteries is not tight enough. I have had my batteries fallen to the ground at least three times. Have to have this Camera case returned due to its poor design.
0,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased this software, used it religiously, and REGRET IT! I had put my entire guest list into this software, every address every phone number etc. Now, the program will load but the guest list will not, it simply freezes on this page. With my wedding only a month and a half away I've had to re-compile my list and look back up 240 addresses because their tech support does NOT EXIST, I have called, e-mailed, e-mailed e-mailed, etc to no avail. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!"
0,Disgusting packaging!,"Whether you like this series or do not, does it really need to be packaged in a case shaped to look like a zombie head with a screwdriver stuck in his head and blood gushing out all over? Honestly, don't we have enough of this kind of tawdry imagery in our culture already?"
1,husband loves it,My husband asked me to get this for him while he was deployed. He was glad to get it and it was exactly what he was expecting. Nice size. Not too big and not too small. He has never had a problem with camelbak products.
1,Beautiful book - the images will stay with you forever,"I was given a second hand copy of this book as a little girl in the early 80's. I remember being totally captivated by the drawings. I spent hours trying to draw like those illustrators - sometimes I drew inside the book itself. Eventually my book began to fall apart and I believe it was thrown out. As a mother now, when I have bought books for my children I have held books up to this standard; are they captivating... will my children get ""lost"" in this book. I have never a book like this one in terms of illustrations. However, I could not remember the name of the book. Only that it was a book of beautiful fairy tales and I could distinctly remember the Little Match Girl story. I found the book on google images and then with the title was able to find it for sale on Amazon. This book is on the top of my Christmas list this year."
1,G,"One of her good books, not great. Ending left you hanging a bit. Otherwise the storyline was fairly interesting and read nicely."
1,great socks for hubby,"Watch out! Nowhere does this ad say these are men's socks, so wearing a size 10 women's shoe, I ordered an XL. When they arrived, I realized I had just bought my husband a very nice pair of snowblowing socks."
0,Original thought,"This movie had an original idea, but lact so much for being a zombie movie. At times it was just stupid! Another zombie movie id pass on. Doubt I'll be re-watching this movie any time soon!"
1,A Real Hit with Our 18-month old Grandson,"I got this for our 18-month old grandson for Christmas and this was just the thing for him to satisfy his craving to climb in, around, and behind things! It was larger than I expected, big enough for both of us to sit in, which he loved. Its only been up two days but it seems durable because in the beginning he seemed to try batting it around to test it out and it held up admirably. The colors are bright and it seems well made. I feel certain that he'll play in it often."
0,Doesn't fit my car,"I used Amazon's drop down menus to make sure this filter fit my make/model/engine. Although Amazon said it fits my 2009 G6 GT 3.5L engine, it does not. I have a sedan, so maybe this is the coupe filter? I don't know, and apparently Amazon doesn't either."
1,over-rated masterpiece,"With ""Ray Of Light"", Madonna tried to please all the people who act intellectual, that is the reason why this album has been so succesful, because since this kind of music sounds ""oh so mature"", people felt intellectual if they liked it. That's why I give it 4 stars and not 5. Don't misunderstand me, ""Ray of Light"" is a great album but for some reasons, I don't believe that Madonna was completely sincere when she made it. It still remains a very good album with great lyrics and amazing music so if you don't have it, buy it."
0,Practically useless,"This is a cute little book, but if you're really interested in learning to be a Santa, save your money. It's nothing more than a cute little book. It is practically useless if you're looking for information on ""How to be Santa Claus."""
0,Disturbing and Disgusting Dribble,"Why Disney Film Studios have decided to put their support behind this sacraligous and disturbing novel suprises me. Not even Walt Disney, who lets face it, is not commonly regarded as one of the stalwarts of mental health would treat Cordy's novel as ""normal"".This book is not entertaining.This book is not clever.This book is not good.This book is disturbing.This book is religously corrupt.This book is not the type that should be encouraged, supported, or turned into a feature film.Do not waste your money on this book, especially if you have or at any time have at any semblance of religous faith. If you possess any compassion or understanding of Christian ideals, again, do not purchase this book. You will regret it."
0,Exactly the same as the Home Depot boxes,"At $100 for three, I was expecting more from these. Perhaps bigger, heavier, sturdier, more robust? Nope! I have a number of Home Depot storage crates (at a fraction of the cost of these) and the Home Depot boxes are better! Stay away from Akro-Mils. I'm very disappointed."
0,Don't get excited about this one---,"There's original music-and then's there more of the same. This is more of the same. Just like Kings of Leon, take some guys, put them in a room with old records like the CLASH (I hear London Calling right now in track 10), Led Zep (track 11-I hear Heartbreaker now). I know the critics love this one-but remember two things-first, they get the music free-not having to pay for it like us, and secondly, it's ""wilding"", one critic goes wild about the next new thing and the others follow-just like a pack of schoolkids. Why do I even read their reviews? As for the others here, how do I explain them-I don't. It's somewhat like hearing and liking what others tell you to like. Think for yourself and buy something else, like Ray Davies. I'm close to the end of listening to this disk for the third time. Now, I dislike it more than before and have gone from two stars back to one star because I can't do zero stars."
1,Great Deal!!!,"This is perfect and a great price for ALMOST anyone. the only catch is that if you're ear is too big the earpiece might not fit right, but for the average sized person or smaller this is perfect"
1,Old School Flavor w/New School Hits,Art Official Intelligence... Who would have thought that De La would have stood so strong? The new album is fresh and innovative with hooks that are off the hook. Various artists that appear on tracks add flavors of R&B as well as old school rap. Thank you Beastie! AOI gives us somthing to think about as well something to dance to. Change of pace. Thanks to De La.
0,disappointed :-(,"so what,I didn't cry. I'm not a heartless person,mind you,I read 'the notebook' and cried alot but this book...well...didn't quite follow up.I think the writer tried too hard to make this book..sad..but it's not! the most emotional scene for me is when Landon and Jamie exchange christmas gifts and that's all.I'm bad at writing review and I don't want to criticize too much, but having the girl died from leukemia at the end of the story, come on! what is this,erich segal's? I have to say this is disappointing. (ok, sorry for criticized too much)"
1,Highly Recommended!,"very good quality phones they're crystal clear, have great bass mids and highs don't worry if the high end sounds a little laid back at first, it opens up after some burn-in very natural sounding and nice fold up design definitely the best headphones under $100!"
1,Excellent,"Smart. Exciting,seen all 5 years. Gets better as time goes on.i look forward to the next season..very different and worth watching."
0,Dumb design,"It advertises two mirrors - one magnified and the other regular. However, you really only have the magnified mirror as a choice, as there is no way to get light with the regular mirror. How dumb is that? I only wanted the regular mirror and assumed the magnified mirror would be an option, not my only choice. The magnification is so huge that you can barely see - I just see a giant chin instead of being able to view my face. What a waste of money. I returned this immediately."
0,Very Poor Material,"This was the worst book on parenting I have ever read. When I read the author's recommendations for smacking, spanking, and tieing the door shut, that was the final straw. What generation was this written from!!?? We have enough abused children, who are living with the consequences of this from their own childhoods, without having some other author recommending further abuse (all in the name of love right?).. This book is a mixture of good and very bad.. A book taht is schizophrenic in it's approach.. highly against recommending this book."

1,Chronicles of Old Salem: A History in Miniature,"Here in the most selective form is covered the colonial expansion of England during which Massachusetts was founded. The growth of Salem is traced frm 1626 to 1932 against the state and national scene. The author traces the history of witchcraft from 1484, when a Papal decree made it a crime, to Salem's participation in the mass madness. The book covers the Quaker whippings, the military disaster of King Philip's war for Indian and white survival, the privateering years in which Salem became so great a sea power that Salem meant America in exotic ports of the world.Comprehensive in scope, the book is authenticated by leading scholars in America and England, contains bibliography, index, addenda, and is illustrated with twenty-eight selections from the Essex Collections."

1,fantastic!,My family loves me now that I use my Cuisinart Ice cream maker at least once a week. It is so fast and easy to use. You can be creative and you will have the best tasting ice cream in about a half hour. You will never buy ice cream again. It will pay for itself. You will want to treat it will care for sure I can see where its parts handle with care items. I keep the inside parts in my fridge at all times so I can make Ice cream at anytime. I eat a vegan diet and I have made even vegan Ice Cream with it and it was great. But my family loves the great real ice cream I make about twice a week. I was alittle dissapointed it had a small dent in the side when it first arrived. that is my only problem with the machine. I would say order this if your want to make a happy family. and you want to control what you put in your families food!
1,Bugs hate it,"This is a great thing for zapping bugs. The bees in the summer are dreadful, but I can always get them with the Bug Zapper. Have given this for gifts and everyone has liked them."
0,Buy at your own risk..,"I purchased two of these lights for my driveway and garage apron. As noted, the plastic globe is very cheap and will crack easily. AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THE COMPLETE LIGHT TO GET A NEW PLASTIC GLOBE. Too bad, they do not offer a plastic globe replacement or even a Metal globe.I have not been able to find a replacement globe. I will not buy this light again when the globe breaks.I DID NOT BUY MY LIGHTS FROM THIS BUYER, BUT LOCALLY AT HOME DEPOT, ON SALE.The lights does put out a lot of yellowish light. One will light up a driveway or a garage. The auto sensor for nite and day feature is great.I would like one with a metal globe since my cabin gets winds and snow that could destroy the plastic ones."
0,Disappointing,I am actually kind of disappointed in this amplifier. I was hoping for huge improvements in my reception. It helps just a little bit. There is a little bit less fuzz and slightly improved sound quality but the improvements are modest at best.
0,Yancey marvelous but subject comes short of expectation,"As a lifelong admirer of Yancey's work, I do not believe this is among his best work. Although impressive, the title is a little misleading. I did not come away with much insight other than a couple of old testament quotations that were presented in a modern light. I had honestly expected more fundamental revelation such as I found in Richard Patton's marvelous ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"". Although lucidly written I didn't find the mother-lode the title would suggest."
0,Eeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!,"I am a big fan of 80s music, next to country. They totally ruined some of my favorite songs. They were by people you don't even know. They totally ruined one of my favorite songs, ''Karma Chameleon'' by Boy George!!!!!! They totally ruined ''Billy Jean'' and ''Time After Time.'' The original artists would say ''EEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''"
0,Don't waste your time and money,"I started having problems with this from the first week. The remote stopped working on CDs and would not advance the song. I would have to go up to the machine and advance songs manually. I was willing to live with that but then a DVD wouldn't eject. I read the reviews beforehand and knew this wasn't a top-end or durable machine but I didn't expect a product this bad. Like other reviewers have said, I will never buy a Phillips product again. Not worth it."
1,Get to know your Average Joe - and yourself,"I realy enjoyed this book, and am glad a took a chance on something that's not my normal preference.The book spans 20 years of Larry's life, culminating in his party. After a few chapters you begin to see how many little experiences and conversations shape your life. He passes through loves, jobs, homes and conflicets just like anybody else. But by uncovering his patterns, you see yourself and your own patterns.Read this book - not to knock your socks off, but to get a better understanding of how every decision you make in every day of your life can be one of many to alter your future."

1,Makita 12V Batteries,"I purchased 2 of these model 1222 Makita 12v batteries to get me back up and running again. Both of my previous batteries had gone down relatively close to each other. I had contemplated upgrading to an 18v tool, but that would have more than doubled my cost. For the DIY work that I do, these are just fine. The only rub that I have is that they are purchased through a third party and you can't take advantage of the super saver that is offered through Amazon directly. Outside of that, the shipment was flawless - on time and in perfect condition. These batteries come in a carded blister container."
1,Perfect knife,This is one fine knife.Prior to this my favorite knife was a Gerber Balance plus 10 inch chefs knife I bought over 20 years ago. This is a much better knife. The balance and grip feel is much more natural.
0,"Sick values, great pictures","This book puts forth a sick message that friendship must be bought at the price of their unique advantages and talents, that conformity and uniformity are prime values. The ending -- in which the Rainbow Fish, having given away all but one of his scales, ends up the happiest fish in the sea for having as many ""friends"" (who are only friends because he paid them) as the other fish -- is horrible, suggesting to children that happiness comes through buying ""friends,"" conformity and monotony. The inevitable subsequent plight of the former Rainbow Fish when his ""friends"" realize he no longer has anything to give them is left untold and unrealized. The message this book sends to children is a life-destroying evil one.That having been said, the pictures are really good, and maybe the message of the book will be ignored for the pictures, which is what gives it 2 stars rather than 1."
1,motorola hs850 bluetooth,The only comment I have has to do with the comfort of the earpiece. It is quite narrow and feels uncomfortable after wearing it for 10 min. or more.The quality of the sound is good.
0,Bad compromise,"The virtue of this machine is that it makes a small loaf of bread quickly. The downside is that it does this one task badly. Because there is only one rise cycle, it makes a terrible loaf of bread suitable only for those with the lowest standards."
1,Charlie the Chicken is fun cover to cover!,"I read this book to my toddler grandson so many times that after a while he ""thought"" that he could read too! The pop-ups are great and when you add ""sound effects"" it's even more fun to read! I've even read it to him over the phone, and he found it thoroughly amusing. The really great thing is that the pop ups have not come loose or torn like most pop up do. We highly recommend this book!"
1,Ferris Lives!,"One of the best of the 80's ""teen films, ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" remains one of the most appealing, funny, well made films aimed at the 80's teen set. Ever confidant Ferris Bueller recruits his best friend Cameron, and his beautiful girlfriend Sloan to blow off school and spend a beautiful spring day exploring the sights and sounds of Chicago. Fun then, fun now, and the scene in the art museum is still the best part of the movie!"
1,pavement,"in my opinion this album is worth it for one reason alone. 23 songs in 47 minutes, it may not have the majesty of the fine albums to follow, which ever be your favorite, but it showcases pavement in the early nineties, its beautiful on vinyl and not much more than the cd , well worth owning"
1,excellant toy!,this toy was bought when my son was 18 mos old and he loved it! he has played with it almost everday. he is now 2 1/2 and still plays with it. we are now buying him the build n go city. i highly reccomend this toy based on our experience.
1,How can you rate any less than 5 stars!?!?!?,"I've watched about everything Tobe Hooper has put out, and I think he has outdone himself with this one. Infact I'd say this surpasses Texas Chainsaw, and will definatly remind you just a tad of Funhouse......but without the illogical death scenes!Oh man, great great GREAT twist in plot. I can not believe I put this off for so long, this is a slasher, but then again it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VERY much more.A movie for intelligent horror fans.P.S. That May chick is back as the lead acress. I'm beginning to like her. :)"
1,Hard n Heavy,"A debut album from the Candian band ""Anvil"". I purchased this after listening to ""Metal on Metal"". Another great album, Robb Reiner's a monster on the drums. I enjoyed the cover of ""Paint it Black"", kind of a weird choice, but at least they played it in their own style instead doing a carbon copy remake. If you've purchased other Anvil albums and enjoyed them, pick up Hard n Heavy too."
1,Buying again,I really love this CD. I played it almost every night for my twins who are now 8 for several years. I had many other lullaby cds and tapes but this is by far the most enjoyable for them and me. The first song on the CD is enough to bring tears to a mother's eyes. We moved last year and I can't find our CD so I am buying again to keep in our permanent collection for when my twins want to feel that extra measure of love and security again one feels when hearing something that was special to them ago.
1,"Well-designed and built, but reception could be better.","This is a large, heavy and well built radio. The only disappointment for me was that the reception was not as good as other reviews seemed to indicate. I was hoping it would pull in some of the local but weaker AM stations like my table-top AM receiver does, but the reception is more like a good pocket radio, so those stations still have a fair amount of background static. The stronger AM stations do have a nice full sound though, so if reception isn't a big concern it's one of the most solidly made radios I've ever seen and an excellent choice for a shower radio."
0,Disappointing,"Underpowered, nearly unusable, without any fine tools. The tools there are do not accomplish the job they were designed for. One star is probably too high."
1,Worth the read!,"I absolutely enjoyed this book. I had to read it in one sitting. I hope there is a sequel or, at least, another book with Kitty Harding."
1,Super!,"I spent a good deal of my adult life in the military, and I'm a hard sell when it comes to realism in military books. Even guys like W.E.B. Griffin and Tom Clancy with their great books can't approach this author for realism. I'm amazed! Dave Meadows has done a superb job of blending this unmatched realism with a great yarn. The result is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. How long do we have to wait for another one?"
1,Before the Rainbow Nation....,"There was apartheid. An evil stain across the face of a great nation. As it started to crumble, Brown wrote about what might happen, if....It was actually rather nice, if not down-right gob-smackingly amazing - to find apopular U.S. author who specialises in techno-military-thrillers acknowledging that life does exist south of the Equator.Bond writes good stuff. This a great, galloping read. It proceeds at an enormous pace, like a grass fire across the veldt. Anyone who enjoys a story of sweat, blood, terror, and war... well, this one's for you. Enjoy."
0,Unusable.,"The idea behind this product is pretty cool. Unfortunately, I just can not make it function properly.1) It frozed on me every second times I tried to forward to the next song.2) It seems down grade the mp3 file to a lesser quality file before play it. It may not be very noticeable for my 192kbps files. But it make my 24kbps files(audio books) into segments of sound pieces like hearing a radio station just out of range.Eventually, I have to return it even though I bought it in a very attractive price ($45 AR with 256MB drive)."
0,Ho Hum,It was developed in 1300 AD. They shared ancient world paganism. Man was a creation of god. They lived in towns. The knights adhered to chivalry and priests & monks lives were based on religion. The church was concerned with this life as well as the next. Leonardo da Vinci personified the renaissance spirit.
1,Awesome Product!,"I totally fell in love with it the moment I got it. It's a great product, takes amazing picture, and is worth the money. I got a super deal here too, with the 18-200mm lens. I had a friend how had it for a greater price than I did. Like all DSLR cameras, you need to learn how to use it if you have not used one before. But it is really worth it. Allows me to take pictures I was not able to before. You can see the difference."
0,Print head gone after 16 months,My mfc printer was not working ok since about a couple of months. Today when I call up Brother help line they say that the print head is gone and may have to replace it ($150) value! . I have not taken more than 300 prints in these 16 months . Not worth buying this machine.
1,PT Cruiser Radiator,I am very happy with this radiator. Fits my 2005 PT cruiser classis 5 speed perfectly with no problems. Quality is just as good as OEM.
1,Love Sweet Smell..90% not fake,"I am 90% sure that it is not fake, it has sweet smell and all that; but for some reason I felt that this is not close to the very sweet smell of burberry brit I sampled at the mall...But that could just be my ability to not match up the smell..I do like the sweet smell of this fragrance"

0,hmmm.,This movie was quite hard to understand. And it seemed a bit gay at times.. Not somthing i would watch again. I liked Helena Bonham carter much better in room with a view!
1,best bang for your buck,"no doubt, after trying most honeys, this is the best (although everyones tastes may vary). two things set it apart from the next best one on the market, ""really raw honey"":-organic-firm textureif you want a softer honey with the propolis (wax and some other pollen granules that are full of nutrition) go with the 'really raw' brand. keep in mind, though, that its not organic and may have pollen from GE crops."
0,The show is good,"The show is actually good and fun to watch, but it was not on Amazon Prime so I had to pay extra for it. A good show but not that good"
1,Chilling - and entertaining story. Excellent sound quality!,"""The Curse of Dracula"" is one of the best 'radio dramas' that I've ever heard. The story is a riveting update of the Bram Stoker novel, and it feels very modern and moves along at a brisk pace. The overall sound quality is amazing, nice stereo feel, with very realistic sound effects and a masterful score. It sounded like a feature film to me. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good Gothic horror story or radio drama."
0,Worked well until warranty ran out - Then it Died,Actually...pretty good photos. Never tried printing on CDs. The problem came 7 days after the warranty expired and the printer stopped working (had only been used for occasional photos and papers). I tried to get HP to stand behind their product (I'm a repeat customer) but to no avail. HP does not care about the customer once the dollars are in the company's pocket.
1,awesome,My 3 year old daughter loved it. Watched it over and over again . Would recomend to anyone and is a great movie for all ages.
0,This book will strip girls of a precious gift.,Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine. Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant.
1,it is great and I was pleased,when i reade this book it was lick a shock to me and my brothers he went through so much pain and life thertings. I just wish that more peopel were positvi back then. Iwould recomend it to any young adult for them to see whates it lick to live a hard life.
1,Versatile as possible,"I put this switch into a 1976 Fender Strat. It fit perfectly even though the switch is considerably wider than the original. Wired it up and it works flawlessly. Action is a bit stiff, but hasn't had much use yet.This is a 4-pole 5-throw (position) switch that can access nearly all of the wiring positions possible on your guitar. Here are two wiring examples. For two humbuckers, connect lead #1 to hot, lead #4 to ground then leads #2 and #3 to the poles (repeat for the other pickup). This provides a simple way of getting any in-phase combination of humbucking or parallel from all four coils. For three single coils, wire lead #1 of the neck pickup to hot and lead #2 of the bridge pickup to ground. Connect the other four wires to the poles of this switch and get nearly any combination of parallel and humbucking you desire."
0,"possible, but not probable",apollo 18 is a hard movie to follow. it was not well made but i still found it interesting. i think they need to remake this one. i beleive in this vast universe we cannot be alone and this movie in my opinion was not worth the price.
0,DO NOT ORDER,DO NOT ORDER!!! do not buy from this seller...you item will not be shipped. Had to cancel order and go through a headache with customer service because of this seller.
0,Just OK,"I own the Samsung LNS4096D 40 inch. The picture quality is suberb. I realized that the LNT2353H televion was NOT 1080p but I expected it to be much better than it was. I adjusted the contrast, brightness, sharpness,etc. until the cows came home. It was still very dark and grainy. Bottom line, I returned."
1,One of 8th wonders of the world,"I BOUGHT VINNIES ALBUM AS SOON AS IT BECAME AVAILABLE IN THE UK.I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS CD.MY FAVOURITE HAS TO BE BRUCE LEE.LISTEN TO VINNIES PLAYING ON THIS TRACK,THERE IS A SIMALARITY BETWEEN BRUCE LEE AND HIS CHOPS,AND VINNIE WITH HIS.BOTH ARE AT THE TOP OF THERE ART.FINAL THOUGHT.TO BE THE BEST YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO THE BEST.I LOVE AND RESPECT YOU VINNIE."
0,Bad,"This book is bad. It is poorly written and the programs did not work on my computer. Even the first project--intended as a simple confidence-builder--required that the code be completely rewritten. Deciphering the author's programming was maddening. Also, some of the projects are dumb: is anyone *really* going to build a burglar detector from this book?"
0,Diluted For Radio,"If you're smitten with Tool, you'll probably discover Mer de Noms to be a paltry side-project. The popular radio-tease ""Judith"" is perhaps what all Tool followers have grown to know and love from the mouth of Maynard James Keenan, however that is the only tenacious track on the album. If you're looking for a return to the condensed viscosity of Tool, don't look for it in A Perfect Circle. Given those involved with its production, Mer de Noms was recorded, mixed and mastered extremely well, but someone put a muzzle on Mr. Keenan. A Perfect Circle is clearly another band."
1,One of the best CD's EVER!!!!,"I just got this CD yesterday, but it is sooooo great! ""The Wreckoning"" is a great song, and the reason I got it. You may have heard ""CrazyLove"" on Crossroads and ""Wasting My Time"" on 8 Mile.It was cool how they dedicated this disc to their dad, who I am pretty sure of passed away.(R.I.P., maybe)Buy this CD and you'll see why it is so great! Buy it. NOW!!!"
0,Busted,"It looks great but unfortunately I have not been able to use my Toshiba Regza as during the shipping process it was damaged. EGL delivered the TV late with the box in a terrible state which looked like it had been dropped and dragged. The LCD screen is shattered which can only be seen when it is turned on. Suggestion from Amazon ""I would be more than willing to refund you 10% of the total order, which would be $128.00, for keeping the item. If that doesn't work for you I can issue a replacement free of charge. Since this item does require a specialty shipper we would not be able to expedite the shipment."" Hopefully this gets resolved as I have faith that Amazon values their customers.Toshiba REGZA 42HL167 42"" 1080p LCD HDTV"
0,"Going, Gone!",I will start off by saying SHORT. 2 Hrs max. The concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through 3 times to max them out. Also the Story lines for each character aren't worth playing them through either. When you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases. The graphics are nice which they should be. Expected more from Square but wait I usually do......and they usually don't.
0,BEWARE......the formula has changed!,"Canidae has changed their formula and it is also now being made by the Diamond pet food company. Do your research...many, many users of this new formula have dealt with very sick dogs. There is nothing on the packaging that states ""new formula"". I noticed a change when I opened the package...different color of kibble. I checked the ingredients llisted on the back and compared to an outdated brochure from the company. I thought that the new formula would be OK. I haven't had the severity of problems that others have had, but after reading several postings at different sites, I susupect that the changes I have observed in my senior golden in the last month or so has to be the food! Time will tell..she gets homemade food tomorrow."
1,the only game I can play 24 x 7,Excellent stuff. Makes me go out of control. I keed promising myself that I will stop playing after this step ... and keep on going ..
1,Greatest motivator to get moving EVER,"I received my Sportbrain almost two months ago. I have more than doubled my activity level since then. The tracker is super easy to use and so lightweight its not noticable. The website has a great user interface and the absolute best customer support anywhere. The online forums are a great way to meet other people in the same boat whether you are a triathlete or a beginning walker. I am so hooked and I do not see the novelty factor wearing off anytime soon. Neither do the ""sportbrainers"" of 8+ months so I am not to worried!"
1,Pleased with quality for the price,"I recently ordered Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus, brushed chromeVery pleased with the prompt service and quality for the price. It is just right for my needs and easy to store as I am in an apt. with a smaller kitchen than when I was younger. One thing that you might want to improve on would be clearer instructions as to how to assemble the cover of the cup in order for it to make contact with the power. I am a widow and my husband was the one with the mechanical ability. Thankfully, I did get it figured out and am enjoying the ease of chopping and grinding. Thanks, CuisinartNorma Hovland, Bloomer, WI"
1,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR,"IF YOU ARE A TRUE R&B LOVER THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD.FOR SURE GET GONE IS THE BOMB.BUT THEN YOU HAVE JEALOUS SKYS,WILL NEVER LET YOU GO,TELL ME WHY,AND I DONT MIND.THIS IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM FOR THIS TO BE THERE FREASHMAN ALBUM.TRULY NOT A WASTE OF MONEY CAUSE ALMOST HALF OF THE CD'S SONGS ARE HITS.THIS IS ONE MUST HAVE CD."
0,Save your receipt!,"This iron died on me after about six months -- apparently something wrong with the digital chip, as the display shows ""error"", and the iron doesn't heat up. Black & Decker customer service is not too interested in helping unless you save your receipt. I must say, I am not in the habit of saving my receipts for every $30-40 purchase I make. My mistake, I guess, but I will not be buying another Black & Decker product anytime soon!"
1,This thing is kinda amazing...but can be hard to clean.,"I mostly use the mitt and I must say that it wipes away what my pricey cleansers seem to leave behind. Its a must in summer when I'm feeling especially hot and gritty and really want to ""feel"" clean. I barely need to use a cleanser - just wet the mitt and wipe and tadah (no dry skin, no itchiness)! However, for all its great work at getting my face clean, it is difficult to get/keep clean. It always looks ""stained"" even if I bleach and soak it. I haven't used the headband myself - I've used on my daughter to keep her hair from getting wet while she ""swims"" in the tub....works well. Smile!"
0,BASURA-TRASH,"Este album es basura, prefiero escuchar mucho barato y artilleria pesada mil veses otra vez ke escuchar cualquier cancion de este disco. No sirve no tiene ritmo no es hip hop."
1,Fred Hammond is truly a man of God and a blessing to all!!,Fred Hammond outdid himself this time with Pages of Life. This CD will be an all time favorite of mines. The songs of praise and worship is so awesome that you can't help but to hear them ringing in your head and spirit all day long. Fred Hammond is truly an example of what Christian Gospel music should be like. Something for the old and also something for the young people. I pray that God will continue to use him mightily in this day and time.
1,greenes,We have a 40 pound dog. Every morning when we leave for work we pull out one teenie greenie and our dog goes right to her kennel. We do not buy the recommended size for her. The small are used as a treet which she likes. Her breath is always good.
0,"They used to call them ""Snake Oil Salesmen""","I regret that I too was suckered by this product. Please don't make the same mistake. The unit burst open on the first day, rendering it completely useless, because you cannot contact the company (what company?) to get spare parts to repair it. Worst scam I've fallen for in a long time. THESE GUYS BELONG BEHIND BARS. Should have known better when there was no 800 number or info of any kind about the company on the packaging. Tried to save a few bucks and wound up getting totally burned. If you want to consider a class action, contact me - I'm all for it."
0,you've got to be kidding me,"i recently heard her for the first time on the radio - her ""hit single"" is nothing but a computer-generated piece of garbage. it's not even her singing!! i just don't understand how anyone can see this as a great piece of musical work. i think it's a hoax and a sorry shame that albums such as this get so much exposure, when truly talented artists (who can write more profound lyrics than those about lovin', lyin' cheatin', foolin' etc.) cannot get any airplay. if you're a pop culture junkie, then i guess this album is for you: it's a piece of junk."
0,Sturdy but uncomfortable.,"The keyboard does what it promises. It's very sturdy and looks like it will last a long time, but I have a few issues with it:The keys are very loud. Some people disagree, but this is the loudest keyboard I can recall using.Another thing that bothers me is that the keys are much harder to press than I'd like compared to previous keyboards I've used. Its a strain on my hands, but they're very small so others may not have the same problem.Another reason for this may be that it's a fairly tall keyboard with no room to rest your palms, and my hands are forced to be angled upwards. (rather than comfortably above the keys.)Maybe it's because my previous keyboard was particularly quiet and easy-to-press, but I really don't care for the features of this keyboard. It's just not comfortable for me."
0,Develop a Losing Mind,"Supporters of this polemical, profoundly unphilosophical work will (like its author) resort to psychologizing about the motives of its detractors; emotional manipulation is the tool of the reason-destructive individual. Use your own mind and watch Leonard Peikoff perform the same sleight-of-mouth."
0,I like Neil Diamond; I do not like spyware,"I love Neil Diamond, and I have all his albums. All of them except for this one (I did listen to it at a friend's house, though). Why? It's copy-protected, and it's loaded with a device call Rootkit, a form of spyware that cripples and hijacks your computer. When I did a scan on my PC last night, it identified Rootkit as a TROJAN. This terrified me. Every day, I fear for my online safety because Sony wants to make life extremely difficult for innocent consumers. We have the the right to rip and burn legitimate copies of our CDs; face it-- copying music is as old as time itself. But I will never be BULLIED into buying a copy-protected CD. And that's too bad because I love Neil Diamond."
0,Terrible,"I just bought this and I will be returning it. It has alot of nice templates but they are set up for the pictures to go OVER them which means they have to be shaped and cropped to the exact size of the boxes. What is worse is that when you import your picture into the graphics holders on the page it stretches the image, losing the original aspect ratio. If you want to crop the picture it actually says you must load up the included utility and change the picture there, then import it. Anyone with any experience with this kind of thing will immediately realize how ridiculous a concept that is. What a dissapointment. I wish I read the review here before I bought, now I have to waste my time further with a trip back to the store."
0,Just changed the year on the cover,"I bought this same book's 2002 edition as we were to travel to Disney then. Something came up & we couldn't go, so we are going this year. I bought the 2004 edition expecting some updates. When I compared them side by side, they were exactly the same, even down to the page numbers the chapters started on. I think to just change the year on the cover is misleading. The info in the book is good but I returned the 2004 edition and will just use the 2002."
1,"Very, very sweet. Nice ears, too!","It's hard to get away with wearing bunny slippers when you're an adult, but on babies they sure are cute! This set is a good gift risk, in case the baby already has 6,000 copies of Goodnight Moon."

1,Quality for custom creations,"These small magnets are perfect for bracelets and lighter-weight necklaces. It is true that there are different magnetic strengths and sizes - think about what you need the clasp for, and then you will know which clasp to buy. I have used these successfully on many bracelets and necklaces and have never had a customer complaint. These are a great price, too."
0,Paintbrawl,"I bought this game recently and was completely disapointed. I could not even get the auto installer to install it, very unstable. Do not waste your money and time on this first title, as for the second? I don't know, I am afraid to even try with the experience I had on the first one!"
1,Wise and humane,"An enjoyable read, ""Plainsong"" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf write with a realistic, yet kind and graceful, style that ultimately leaves one with hope.Interesting to hear that this will be a Hallmark movie in November. This book isn't sentimental and I hope that will be true of the ""Hall of Fame"" special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising."
0,flimsy,"Falls apart if you use it filled close to capacity. I carry 6-8 pairs of sticks, brushes, and 2 sets of mallets, and had the seams burst on me in under 6 months. If you need to carry 5 or fewer pairs of sticks, it's probably fine."
1,Must Read for Single Men,"Leil does provides a descriptive and informative approach to understanding a woman's body language, signals they give off and their underlying motivations.

0,Should have waited...,"I'm going to give this machine 2 stars because the alternative of scrubbing with a mop is worse.That being said, this machine is easy to assemble and it's directions are clear.I use this machine on sealed wood floors in my dining room and kitchen. It is easy to use, however, no matter what I tried, I could not get the floors clean without streaking. I used less water, more water, moved it ever so slowly, agonizingly so in fact. To no avail.The machine does get the floor clean but if I want a shiny floor I have to add an extra step and use a mop with a polish to remove the streaks. And the whole process takes three times as long to do as the back-breaking mop method.So since I've had poor performance from Hoover vacuums, I should have known better and just waited for Dyson to demonstrate the right way to build one of these machines.Others may have had a better experience with tile floors, however my experience on wood floors is abysmal."

1,Beautiful Disney Movie Song Instrumental Lullabies,I was tired of listening to the same Baby Einstein Lullaby cd over and over again while getting my little one to sleep. This Disney Instrumental Lullaby cd is perfect! It has numerous Disney movie songs turned into beautiful instrumental lullabies. It's very soothing and not too loud or fast. I highly recommend it!

1,Works good,It is nice to be able to see my heart rate when working out. You have to apply moisture to the band before you put it on or it will not work.
0,bad design,"They tried to make it sleek and modern looking but the result is the round bottom keeps you from ever setting it down without it falling over.Sometimes you just want to set it down to access your camera or accessories and it falls over. Other than wearing it you can not conveniently get at anything.There are times when you want to put it on a table while you do something and bloop over it goes. If they had just made it with a square bottom I would have loved it. The tapered sided also keeps you from storing accessory lenses along side the main camera, at least lenses of medium length. Construction is great, comfort is great, and as a swing to the front quick access bag it is also great. it's just a pain any time you take it off. Laying it flat on it's back works ok but it is a pain to access your gear that way."

1,This book is a jewel,"This 56 page book by C. S. Lewis is a jewel. C. S. Lewis says that God gave us conscience -- a sense of right and wrong. As a car is made to run on petrol, God designed the human machine to run on Himself. Lewis says that when you argue for or against God, you are arguing with the very power that allows you to have any reasoning at all. Then Lewis tells how God chose a particular people(Jews) and showed them who He was and hammered into them right conduct. Then among those Jews, Jesus lands on an enemy-occupied world in human form. His death puts us right with God and gives us a fresh new start if we repent. Lewis tells us very succinctly how the death of Christ is just that point in history at which something absolutely unimaginable from outside shows through into our own world."
1,Meyer is Among the Elite,"This rendition of Mozart's K622 is possibly the most well known recording made by the greatest female clarinetist in history. Behind Marcellus and Shifrin, this is the top Mozart Concerto you could have in your music collection. Meyer, characterized by her famous dark German tone, plays the Rondo with such a cheery and jumpy tone that it makes this recording of the final movement unsurpassed by anyone before or after."
0,Non-support for defective products by Soleus,"I read all the reviews, crossed my fingers because of the reports of poor support by Soleus and ordered the 25-pint version. It failed to work out of the box. The light came on, but it didn't power up. I called and was able to reach a Soleus representative who pointed out that according to the manual, Soleus would not pay shipping charges under any circumstances. So, I've returned the unit to Amazon and assume they will not charge me for the return shipping. Now I'm reading other product reviews, but I really wanted this one!"
0,Some computers do not recognize the download program included,"Have seen this work. Nice. HOWEVER, not all computers recognize the download program. CANNOT connect to technical support. Always says mailbox is full. My computer says access denied for this program. Running on windows xp. Very disappointed that company doesn't have a technical department that answers their phone!!"
0,Good for reading - not for searching,"I bought this through whispernet - in a hurry at the airport, with no opportunity to check online opinions. Had I done that, I would not have bought this edition. I like the NKJV, for reading and studying, but as others have mentioned, getting to a specific chapter and verse is painful. The 5-star reviewer wrote ""just search for Psalm 100"" - unfortunately, that's only true for the Psalms. When I was trying to get to Isaiah 66, I thought I'd start at Jeremiah and try the ""prev"" page button instead, but I got pages of footnotes to go back through before getting there.For straight reading, this is fine; but if you're looking for something equivalent to flipping through your Bible for specific texts (for example during a sermon) don't buy this."
0,"Crappy battery, terrible customer support","I bought this crappy system about 6 months ago. The battery died and would not charge. Customer service was non-existent. They sent me to a website that sent me to another website and I still could not find a replacement battery for this system. Save your money, do not buy this piece of garbage. The device is mediocre and will not last. Spend a little more and buy from a real company."

1,Great speakers at a great price!,"These speakers look and sound great! I recommend them to anyone who likes to entertain outdoors! Easy to install, easy to use! You can't beat the price either!"
0,It's easier to throw it away than find out what return shipping costs.,"In an over simplified manner, this book should not have the word survival in the title. Here's a quick summary that may help others in deciding that another book is likely more helpful. Dogs and other animals can be dangerous, if something has a warning label/sign then pay attention to that, don't eat mushrooms in your front yard, and finally if you are using tools and or knives be sure to cut away from yourself.Humor is to be found in the suggestion that if you are attacked, defending yourself with anything other than your fists is a bad idea. Wow.I only blame myself for purchasing the book. Now to throw it away."
1,The X Files (aka Fght the Future),"As in all the X Files, the show was great! I wish they would make a ton more of these films with exactally the samestars and crew."
1,"They fought on ground so hard, the bullets bounced!!","James Hallas has written an insightful and informative book on one of the Second World War's most costly battles. The U.S. invasion of Peleliu, 500 km south of the Phillipines, in 1994, was a conflict that chewed through an immense ammount of ordinance and men. It is mostly a one sided account, told from the invading Marine perspective. Indeed it would be hard to gather much from the Japanese viewpoint as most on that side were killed in their courageous but ultimately suicidal defense of the island. I was often left astounded by the tales of indivdual heroism on both sides and the magnitude of the Japanese defenses. The Americans took on a tough nut and cracked it. Hallas gives their story in an entirely readable and well researched book. If you like military history then you'll like this"
1,"A ""Gran Partita"" for the ages","I feel confident giving this disc 5 stars. I've heard the Gran Partita by many ensembles on record and in the concert hall, and this one reaches perfection early and maintains it throughout. Essential."
0,"Repetition, repetition, reputation","Wonderful series prior to this. Shelters of Stone, however, tarnishes Jean M. Auel's reputation. Quite frankly, I don't believe she wrote it herself."
0,Disappointed,"I would have thought that would have corrected the poor visibility of the display with this upgraded model but they did not. Impossible to read from riding position, almost impossible to read after stopping and leaning forward. Poor organization and labelling, and very little contrast.Also there is a problem with the flimsy seat mounting bar as any speed above about 8 mph, with a 6 foot tall person on it, sets up a loud squeaking that overwhelms any entertainment system sound. Resonant frequency problem with weight/height and poorly engineered mounting.Very disappointed in this chinese schwinn.NOT a best buy."
0,Didn't survive the summer.,"I purchased these blades for more money than the competition, based on the name Bosch. They worked flawlessly right off the shelf.After 2 months of summer heat, they tore apart when I actually needed them at 4am on the way for a vacation.1st stop that morning was some highway truck stop to pay even higher prices for new blades!!!Lifetime waranty or any waranty on blades are tough. You'll need to keep the packaging, receipt, or just remember where you bought them and which model they are. I consider myself fairly organized, but for blades it's just beyond me, and I assume the same for most people."
1,blood money: crime incorporated,THIS IS A REAL DECENT BOOK. HAS A DECENT STORY AND A FEW TWIST.WHAT I DIDNT LIKE WAS THE ENDING. THE ENDING MAY SPOIL ALL THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE BOOK THE CHARACTERS ARE GOOD AND ITS ACTION PACKED BUT IT JUST HAS A BUMB ENDING.
0,Epic Fail,"ANY compilation that goes under the uber-boring and generic title ""Greatest Hits"" better, at the very least, live up to the name, no excuses. This compilation, although including many of their hits, is missing ""All That Glitters Isn't Gold,"" which hit #49 and thus, technically, one of their greatest hits. Any comp album with a misleading title is an insult and a failure. Please, go out and get these songs by buying the three fantastic albums they came from and show this awesome group of women some true respect."
1,enthralling,"Well worth a read, whether you are a scientist or not. Entertaining with good explanations, and really makes you think."
1,One my kid's favorites!,Another great book by Rosemary Wells. This book is one of my kid's favorites!
1,Little one liked it!,"An easy way to get the little one accustomed to playing with fruit and how it looks, but don't expect them to eat the same fruit in real life once done playing here. Fun set to explain fruit with, though."
1,The Best of the Best,"I read all the time, it is about the most exciting things that a person can do! I first saw this book at a book store and decided to buy it, it was even signed Tamora Pierce. Little did I know what a wonderful book I was about to read. I fell in love with Alanna instantly. A red head girl who disguses herself as a guy to pursuit her dream, to be a knight. She also possess a magical power called a gift. She over comes obstacles and hardships, and with a lot of hard work her dream becomes true. It is full of laughter and excititment, and you never know what is going to happen next, you can't wait to turn the next page. After I read Alanna I read the rest of the series, and now I own all of Tamora Pierce's books! They are the best books in the world, and if you like fantasy, and a book where a girl does more than her world thinks a girl can, this is a book for you!"
0,Decent DVD but doesn't really work,"I got this because my dog has some serious seperation anxiety and I thought that this would help him but he doesn't really watch it. The first Dog Sitter DVD actually got his attention much better and the guy in this video saying ""good dog"" throughout was kind of creepy. I have heard this worked for some dogs, but didn't work for mine."
1,Outstanding heater,This is an outstanding heater. Puts out lots of heat and very safe around kids. Looks great on the wall.
0,Too much vitamin A,"My doctor told me to stop taking these vitamins because they have too much vitamin A. Most of them that you can buy over the counter seem to. I wish the FDA would regulate that can be called a prenatal vitamin. My doctor ended up giving me a prescription instead, which has no vitamin A."

1,the ventures rock and roll forever,just saw the ventures in new york at the bbking blues cafe still playing great after 50 years keep rockin
0,Pretty Basic,"There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history."
0,The Summons,"If you are an avid Grisham reader, this book will be a great disappointament. The lack of action and plot line is frustrating to read. Without the normal excitment that fills other Grisham books, The Summons is difficult to read completely through. This was definitely not Grisham at his best."
1,A definite step forward,"This is Overkill's 2nd offering, and it's a certain improvement over the original. The sound of the band got originality and style, also a desired heaviness and better songwriting. Most of the album is high-speed aggressive, even violent thrash with instantly recognizable Blitz's poisonous hateful vocal style. Though it may seem dated at present, nonetheless it's a good album and any thrash-metal fan would be advised to buy it. Also know, that the next 3 albums by Overkill are their top, and perhaps you should start from one of them, moving back to the roots in their discography."
1,A great book for bedtime.,"It was not easy for me and my husband to send my 3-year-old boy to bed. He always asked for one more song again and again with tears. This bothered us so much. My husband bought this book for him and we read together before his bedtime. After several days, it did work! My boy went to bed without crying and arguing. I thought he got something from this book. The bedtime is no longer ""bad time"" for us."
0,Not her best work...,"I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback. This was definitely not her best work. Try your library first!"
1,You've GOT TO get this CD!,I just purchased this CD and can't stop listening to it! The songs all have amazing lyrics and the guitar and vocals are simply genius. Mr. LaBauve's passion and sincerity shine through on each song. I am anxiously awaiting Act Two!
1,Dowton abbey,"Great script ,great costume and scenery, plenty of characters you can love or hate,who wouldn't want Carson running there house,,in a word,brilliant,"
0,Buy elsewhere!,I understand that these were from bulk pack but I assumed they would be packaged somehow for sanitary reasons. The two I ordered literally came loose in a mailing envelope. I am completely disgusted. In addition - you can find these cheaper elsewhere in a pre-packaged container of 3.
0,boring noise,"This is nothing but ...,i`m sorry.I tryed to like this but i just can`t and i know why.I`ts a little thing called talent.These guys don`t have any.Sadly gone are the days when a band could put out heavy music with great lyrics,but they could do more then just make noise.Where are all of the guitar solos,or don`t these guys know about those.Avoid this at all costs if you have a brain bigger than 1 cell."
0,AC adapter,Why I even bothered buying this I'll never know - when would I use a GPS inside my home? DUH!
0,Still Shocked,"Well to continue with my previous review I must say after my blender blew the motor on the first use I sent it back in to get repaired in the hopes of getting a new one that I could return to get my money back since they don't give you a refund at Salton unless you purchase it directly from them. Unfortunately they kept it at the repair shop for 3 weeks so of course then the 30 day return period with Amazon was over. So now I'm stuck with another one so I figure I might as well use it, but being the ""WELL MADE"" product it is, once again it burnt up the first time I pulled it out of the box just trying to blend up an ice-cream shake. Looks like I'll most likely be sending these blenders back about 9 more times till my 1 year warranty is up. By then maybe I'll have gotten Salton back with $200 worth of shipping costs. You should be able to put a negative five star rating on here!"
0,Inappropriate,Definitely not for 2-5 years. It goes way too in depth for my son and he's 5. Words like sperm and vagina are too much for small children...
0,Did not like,In this case if a person has to put something like this together - I did not think it would last. I prefer the one piece Presses. I have 3 boys (now teens) but I have to proof everything! LOL
0,Sex on stage,"Why oh why must I watch sex on stage? It was not at all fun to watch this ballet and although the technique was gorgoeus and the lifts superb, the explicit sex acts were too much to bear. If this were a movie it would be rated NC-17. What about art makes it suddenly appropriate? The product was excellent, but the ballet...not so much."
0,the drill is great but the charger is a bust,"The charger for the model CL180 always tended to overheat when plugged in...and finally lasted less than two years despite only light use. And it seems to be unavailable for separate purchase. So apparently I get to throw away a perfectly good, nice, cordless drill for want of a charger!"
1,"Great deal, effective product","As soon as I got it, I started sharpening away the several knives that have been dull for way too long. My pocket knife is back into action with a sharp edge, which only took me minutes to recondition. Affordable and effective for sharpening multi purpose knives."
1,"Catherine, called Birdy, by Karen Cushman","This book ""Catherine called Birdy"" was great book. It had lots of characters, and it was funny how she had to put up with those men. You see, Chatherine is a girl who lives with her mother and father, and she's supposed to get married to a man. So the father tries to set her up with some men, but to Catherine thinks they are hideous. As you keep reading throughout the book,to me, the book gets a little bit funnier every chapter. I really liked this book alot, even though I'm a thiller book fan this book go my attention. Overall I would have to give this book four star, some part were a little boring in some chapters. The book was very entertaining, funny and sometimes boring"
0,What a Disappointment!,"I have been eagerly awaiting the 'Hannibal' book and boy, was I disappointed! It is not the face paced novel like, 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. Instead, Mr Harris gives us a lesson in Italian history and describes with great detail the places that Hannibal has visited. Clarice Starling also is in this novel, having fallen on hard times, her rising star, now fallen. Suspended from the FBI, she is not the first on the scene when we find out who Lecter's identity is. Also, the main villian of this novel is not Lecter, but Mason Verger, a man who is permanently disfigured by Lecter. He now swears revenge on Hannibal, and means to take it by training pigs to eat him from the feet up. The ending of the book is the most unbelievable with Clarice and Hannibal teaming up. I was truly disappointed by the ending. Don't waste your time, re-read 'Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'Thanks for reading!**Pandora"
1,quit enough source,"this book is considered one of the text...that make the specialest so much satisfied by the quality and quantity of the information it contain and the it is discussed. but for us in middle east it is very [pricey]. you will understand that when you know that my monthly salary as an assesstent lecturer inradiation oncology dept.; Alazhar university, Cairo, Egypt;... a low price edition will be much helpful and very wise to prevent illegal copying of the book. thanks a lote"
1,Excellent for the Nuvi 660,"I actually got this bundled with my Nuvi 660. I was initially concerned that the fit was too tight, but over time, the case quickly adapted to the unit and the unit can be slipped in and out with ease, and without slipping out on its own.Pros:1. Excellent quality, fit and finish; minimalist design2. Nuvi 660 will not slip out on its own, but very easy to slip the unit in or out manually3. Inner padding is soft and will not scratchCons:1. Has a pocket that is unusable for all practical purposes; it fits the unit like a glove and there's no space to squeeze anything in thereThe case does not have any extra features; no belt loop or straps or other pockets. This doesn't bother me since I've never had any reason to carry my auto gps unit on my person. I've only needed to throw it into glove box in the car or into my backpack while travelling. For these purposes, this case works great."
0,Bad Purchase!,"Seller was poor at communicating. Didn't respond to message's both voicemail and email.Product sent was not what was requested or purchased. Actual ring was of lessor quality and value and sapphire was a darker blue than shown.Very dissapointed with purchase and extremely annoyed that I am now out of pocket approximately $400 NZD dollars in tax, duty and freight costs for receiving an incorrect product from one of your merchants.This will affect decisions to purchase through Amazon again."
0,Battery died quickly,"Battery died after less than 5 uses. It takes a CR1225 battery which for whatever reason seems to be the one size of button cell battery NOT commonly found in stores (CVS, Target, Fry's, Walgreens, etc)"
0,they sold this as a package to the p1000,this part doesn't even fit the p1000 because the p1000 is not upgradable. cant believe they would sell me this knowing that what a waste of 100 bucks. do not buy this! you cant use it with the p1000 and probably with alot of other bow flex.
0,Into Thin Air 2: The True Story of the Mount Everest...,"Mr. Krakauer should put the above title out next.It's a tad gut wrenching to read how Mr. K. goes to such lengths to shine a better light on himself. And yet, he villifies Anatoli Boukreev who was more heroic on the mountain than anyone.While Krakauer was curled up in his tent, Boukreev was pulling people from their graves.Oh well, IT all evens out eventually."
0,A ton of reading for nothing,"I finished the book yesterday much anticipating it to hit its stride and become interesting. The book felt like it peaked in the first chapter and I spend the rest of it waiting and hoping for a revenge that never comes. I would only reccomend this to people wanting to imagine what life would be like for your family and community if you were murdered, but it is certainly not a page turner."
0,Good in theory,"I guess these served their purpose for protecting the edges of our glass coffee table from our toddler. However, I just spent the last hour trying to take this off. I had to use goo-gone and a razor. Would have ruined my table if it was made of wood. Will not buy again."
1,Loads of fun,My newphew loved this. He is two. Good thing about this is that it was big enough for me to get in there with him. Pop Up is very easy too.
0,impossible to just update 2005 renew.,"My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew. They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software. 2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support. I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this. Shame on you pcillin."
1,great book,"i already wrote a review praising this book, but i wanted to leave another to let people know that they don't have to pay the extravagant prices wanted by the thieves selling here on amazon. simply go to drf.com and you can get this book for the list price of $50. i'm not affiliated with them, i just think it's wrong for someone to try and over-charge by 7 times because someone might not know where else they could get the book."
0,is the writer's strike still going on?,"this movie is aweful, laughed once or twice. I like both main actor's but together they are aweful. idk whos fault it is this movie was horid but they need to be removed from film production ASAP."
1,Good chapter book!,"I am a preschool teacher, and I teach the children in my room German, so I purchased this story to read them. They like it pretty well, as I do translations, but they wanted more pictures!"
0,Painful & Disappointing,"Being a fan of James Patterson, I was eager to begin his new book. After a LONG painful process I finally finished.The plot was far fetched from his ""usual"" writings. His attempt to write this story in the perspective of a female character was his first mistake. His portrayal of ""Frannie"" read more like a romance novel at times and he would have done the book justice by using ""Kit"" as the main character.The abuse of children, newborns and the unborn made for a very morbid and depressing story. Leave the flying children and mutations to the sci-fi writers.One would wonder if he had writers block and tried to resurrect one of his early attempts at writing. Painful and disappointing."
0,Buyer Beware -- Wastes ink for no good reason,"Brother 1800C fax has color ink tanks beside black ink, but they are never used since I only receive b&w fax.The color ink cartridges dry up on their own (about twice in the last 6 months) and the machine will stop printing fax entirely unless you replace the color cartridges.This enables Brother to make a lot of money on ink replacement, but doesn't necessarily present good value for endusers.Paper handling is subpar. The fax jams more frequently than other fax machines I've ever used.In short, save your money and annoyance, buy something else."
0,Same addresses listed over and over again,I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a grant.
1,Happy with the fountain,"I purchased the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain through Amazon.com due to a significantly cheaper price than at our big chain pet stores. ($15.00 cheaper!) I am very happy with the product - cats drink from it with no problems. Why did I rate it a 4? A lot of what I read about it totes that it's quieter than the other models out there. I didn't feel that was true. Also - the little gate that blocks the motor from the hair & debris that can get into the motor - not that great of a blocker, I'm afraid. I think the ""gate blocker"" on the older model from the same company works better. However, not that looks are the final say - but I really like the look of this newer model."
0,More hassle than a normal litter box,"I agree with Cat Lady. I've had this box for about a year now and it's been more of a pain than it is convenient. The rolling option is nice, but lots of little pieces go through the grating and clumps somehow get stuck on the other side of the grating/wall that sit there until you clean the whole box and find a whole army of nuggets. My biggest problem with the box is that I thought this would be big enough for our cat (15-16lbs), but it's not. He's able to get through the hole, but there's no room inside of the box. He's housebroken, yet he still doesn't find enough room in the box, so his butt sticks out of the entrance of the box and he leaves a little mess on the mat for me to clean up. The grating/wall takes about 1/3 of the box up. I took the top off of the litter box and he had no problems. The design needs to be revisited, or why not create an XL version?Bottom line, not big enough for large cats."
1,A Classic Waiting To Happen,"Ever thought the Government know our every move?SNEAKERS won't try to change your mind. This is a fantastic cast (Redford, Poitier, Aykroyd, Phoenix) with an equally witty, sharp and tense script. The story revolves around this team of conspiracy theorists on a retrieval mission of the ultimate password decoder: lethal in anybody's hands.There are some very suspensful moments here, some great comedy (particularly Aykroyd's character who thinks everything is a Government cover-up or conspiracy). Even if technology and hacking doesn't interest you, don't worry. This is a stylish adventure in the best tradition: one worth more than a single viewing."
0,"After 100 days, it is defective","My wife has used it for 100 days without problem. Last night, it doesn't work anymore. Manu. doesn't offer warranty on this product. I have to go to local store to get another one in the mid-night. Poor experience."
0,Just an Overview. . .,"I got this book since it was touted as the first podcasting book. I can now see why it was the first. I got the feeling it was a rushed production from page 2 on. It just touches on programs and other info in later chapters. Plus there are full page pictures of a microphone and other pointless things to take up space. The book if you were to remove the giant sized pictures would be less than 100 pages of actual information. . .if that. I could go on, but you get the idea. Yes, it's the ""first podcasting book"" but that is about all it is. I'm sure others will be better and more informative. . ."
1,Testmant to great music,"You buy it originally on vinyl, then get a tape to take in the car. When it comes out on CD, you buy the CD. Okay, then I found a copy in a used record store and grabbed it to keep in the car. That's what happened with me and ""Heavy Weather.""""Birdland"" drew me into the CD, but there's so much more than this one song to listen to. Weather Report's not just jazz, but a fusion of rock and African music.""Heavy Weather"" is the first jazz I ever bought and still some of the best."
1,"Good, but missing some items","This update to the first edition of Dark Conspiracy by GDW (in 2 parts - the other being the Player's Guide) is a good compilation of the original rules with respect to what the referee needs. It also updates the background (even though some of the dates have now come and gone for this alternate future). However, much of the original material that the back cover says is in the book is left out of this Basic Edition.The Master's edition is a much better version (and is over twice as thick with all the missing items). Regrettably, this was only sold on DPI's web site and is now long out of print and virtually impossible to find (and all the Sin City books and 2nd edition adventures assume you have the Master's Edition).It makes a nice enough addition to a DC fan's library if found for a decent price, but you're probably better off finding the 1st edition rules and supplements and trying to adapt them."
0,Cheap and it shows,"I bought this set thinking that I was getting quite a bargain(saving over $300). The first time we used a knife and washed it in a dishwasher,it rusted. The block is poorly made and the knives do not fit snugly.I am very disappointed with this purchase but I'm too embarrassed to throw them out."
0,The movie was awsome!!! But the book stinks!!,"The screenplay shoul defenitly have more description to it. It is a poor ""transcript"" of the movie, and i pity the one that has that taste.See the movie and you'll see what i'm talking about. Sooooo... much better it's scary!"
0,Cheap build!,"I was cleaning a shelf, and my 5 day old spice rack tipped over, and fell to the ground. It is warped and damaged beyond repair from a simple fall."
1,Ranma 1/2,"The fifth book of Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma 1/2 continues the on going plot of Ranma, a boy who can change into a girl using cold water. Of course, this brings up all sorts of strange and funny situations! The fifth volume is no different! It is still is some of the best and most classic of Takahashi's work. It's very funny and outragious. If love Ranma 1/2 or your just an Anime fan, this book would be great to add to your collection!"
1,Now Available in DVD,"Some good news- this version, along with the 1989 version, is now available from Amazon in a DVD version. Look for ""Thornton Wilder's Our Town: Two Historic Productions (1977)"" and you'll get this version as well as the 1989 Lincoln Center version starring Spalding Gray, Eric Stoltz, Penelope Ann Miller, and Peter Maloney. 3 3/4 hours total for both.And now to my review.This 1977 version is, in my mind, the very best of all I've seen. It's set as a simple play using simple props on an obvious empty stage, which produces powerful results. I love the clean simplicity of this production. It allows the audience to concentrate on the characters- and the characters are very well developed and played with depth.Sorry, but I can't call this version ""flawed"" at all. I first saw it on PBS back in 1977 and found it to be one of the most thought-provoking plays I'd ever seen- live or otherwise."
1,"'Lil Crissy, a Rolled up Twenty, and a Trail of Green Peas","Pecker is a small town happy-go-lucky kinda guy who loves taking pictures... of life when it's just slighty off kilter and ""out of focus"" During his first exhibit, held at his workplace, a local burger barn, he's discovered by a an ultra-urban art-savvy gallery owner from New York City. She brings his work to her gallery someplace in SOHO and he becomes an instant celebrity. But wait, while all the fancy people in the big city laugh at the photos of small town laundry maids and sugar shocked 'lil Crissy - Pecker takes a few snaps for his next exhibit and turns the tables on the fabuart folks from NYC.A true slice of life from many perspectives. It's quite wonderful and not the John Waters you might otherwise tend to avoid. ;)"
1,the song from the Revlon colorstay ad,This is the very same Parisian-sounding track that's featured in Revlon's colorstay ad campaign. Great band from Bristol UK- sort of like Goldfrapp or Mono (Formica Blues). The song is an instant classic. See the video at www.ilya.uk.com
0,broken right out of the box,"warm mist is not working, after 3 weeks of using the cold mist, there is a mold like smell coming out of the unit."
1,Third Day is the man,Me..the biggest third day fan of them all was a little disappointed when I listened to this CD. But how can I not give my favorite band less than 5 stars? But after listening to it a couple times I looked past how much more country they grew and fell in love with the words. Third Day will always cheer me up on a cloudy day! I did like how the songs matched their theme. However when they come out with their next album i hope it's a lot more rock...nonetheless 3day will always amaze me by their awesome lyrics and showing the world they are in love with God.
1,A good read considering it's a dog book.,"Stratton has a way of romantacizing pit fighting and exalting the APBT to a point of near ""god-like"" status. After reading his book, you will be totally convinced that there are only two kinds of dogs. The APBT and those that ""wanna be"". All jokes aside, this book is the main reason that the APBT is one of the most popular dogs today. Although I would advise you keep in mind that his opinions are extreamly biased due to his love of the breed. Nothing he says in the book is necessarily untrue but you may have to take some of it with a grain of salt. Most of his research methods are questionable and based on a ""common sense"" school of thought rather than using any real hard evidence or reliable documentation.Having said that, you will find the book probably more interesting than just about any other book written on any animal whatsoever. You will most certainly find yourself looking for his other titles if you love APBTs as much as I do."
1,Better than the last few.,"""Notorious"" (1991) Did Not ChartWhat happened, again like in 1984, this album just got lost in the shuffle of some mediocre rock albums, this should of charted, still some good tunes on this in, ""Backlash"", with Paul Westerberg, it got some airplay around this part in '91. Other notables, ""Don't Surrender"", ""I Want You"", ""Machismo"" and ""Ashes In The Wind"". This was her mellowest albums, but with some strong song writing, Another 3 year wait till ""Pure And Simple"" , came out."
0,Terrible - Tells you how to be good patient only,"This book is limited in scope and in some of its advice it is misinformed. If you want to be a good patient it may be a good book for you. Otherwise, don't bother buying it or toss it out a window if you have it. I was glad I did not waste my money since it was given to me. My advice, try the Sears' books, Sheila Kritzinger's books, or others along those lines."
0,A total waste of time and money,"While I have regretted buying some books in the past, I never have felt so shamelssly ripped off by a writer. This pap wouldn't make it in a Sunday supplement. Clearly written to cash in on the popularity of the kokopelli arquetype, this book offers absolutely NOTHING in the way of new knowledge or useful information."
0,Not what i had expected..,"For those people who think this is just another Unearth album it is not!! It may have some band member that just carried the name, this is definatly not one of those hardcore albums, i was so dissapointed, however Nirvana fans may like this album, it is definatly different & may take some time to listen to. However, if this is really an Unearth album then it is not thier best album, this is b4 the 'Unearth' we know is formed.. im assuming Mike Rudberg was the person that was in 'this' album & just carried the 'Unearth' name.. my suggestion is if your not rich, dont buy this album. If you got other cds that u can buy, buy those instead."
1,A Must!,Nat King Cole is One Of The Greatest Artists Ever.His Voice is a Diamond unto itself.This Collection Reflects His Genius.He was So RIch in Tone that He Made it Look Too Easy.The Man was In His Own League&Class.
0,TV Ears Quality,"TV Ears does not hold up well at all, the ear pieces come off all the time and plastic piece foam is attached to broke.This is the third set my husband has had and all are junk.I would not recommend TV Ears to anyone."
1,Netgear GA511 Ethernet PC Card,"For anyone with a laptop without a built-in LAN adapter, this is a good solution. After downloading and installing new drivers from the Netgear website, this unit worked flawlessly and as expected right out of the box."
1,Good,"The pills are very large. So I only need to eat one pill per day. For me, it is good because I always forget to eat the vitamins."
1,Excellent pictorial of Napoleon's greatest tradegy,"With Napoleon in Russia is a very handsome book using the illustrations by Faber du Faur showing the consequences of Napoleon's disastrous march to Moscow and back again. It is a unique record and really gives you a feel of the ordeal the soldiers lived through or died from. The book is also an excellent accompaniment to probably the best statistical graphic ever drawn, the map by Charles Joseph Minard visualizing the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in that fateful Russian campaign of 1812. Recommended."
1,Finally from the Perspective of the depression patient,"When I first bought this book I didn't expect much. But, as I read the book and followed the amazing journey Will had to make in the steps to keep control of his depression and not get the better of him the more I enjoyed it. This young man is a true inspiration for kids and young adults who suffer from depression that there are things like hope and a better quality of life awaiting us if we just keep holding on a bit longer to realize it ourselves."
1,Surprising Album!,"Surprising album! Songs are ingenious and simple at the same time, they sound as if they were created in the 70s and played in the 2000s, you feel something new and old combining, something unexpected. This cd is difficult to define or to compare. It seems to take inspiration from the ""english"" pop-psychedelic music (pink floyd?), but then it turns jazzy or rock, and in the end you just want to listen to it again, and again.."
0,Very disappointed,I didn't know there were different series I got a DVD that was released in another country and it won't play
0,Will's best CD overall.,"This was a pretty good cd from will, even though every track was a remake of some old song. The problem with this cd is the lyrics and the way he flows. I understand that he dosen't want to swear since he's trying to set an example for his son, But his flow has got to go. There are only a few songs like ""just the two of us"", ""getting jiggy wit it"",""maimi"" that really show some kind of flow. I think he was better back when he made ""summertime"" and ""Ring my bell"". Now his rhymes are kind of corny and need some edge so that he can get the real MC respect he deserves. he is an excellent actor , but his rapping needs tuning up. Overall this is a good CD if your not too heavy into rap. I really would rate this 2 1/2, but there is no rating button for that."
1,light beer anyone,"This album is funny, and the first track is great along with a few others. for the most part though this contains some really soft material, and several disco tracks(disco is hell, nice joke).While I don't love this album nearly as much as anything released by Alice before it, it can be an enjoyable listen if you are in the right mood for it, just don't buy it expecting somthijng with great guitar riffs or a holloween sound.This is another example of what Bob Ezrin does to his artists when he's had one drug too many."
1,The Nazi Conscience,"A good survey of the cultural and political climate that developed in Germany between 1933-39. Some of her arguments are problematic, the voice of the German public is missing from this account, but overall this is a good analysis of Nazi culture and its racial dimensions."
1,The Best Jango!!!,"This figure is definetely one of the coolest action figures of the Hasbro Star Wars line. 'Jango Fett: Kamino Escape' comes with lots of really cool accessories. Of these are his dual guns which can be holstered, his jetpack, and the coolest one of all: his removable helmet! The face sculpt even has a decent likeness to the actor who played Jango, Temaura Morrison!I don't want to give anything away about this figure, but I can say that there are many surprises in store for the person who purchases this figure."
1,"No filler, all content, still looking for the secret remote codes","Talk about investment - I paid $32 at Borders five years ago. Now that is a rate of return!But I won't part with it. The DVD reminds you of why Tool is an art metal band, emphasis on art. Everytime I watch Stinkfist (""Track #2"" to the MTVheads), I see something new in it.The live songs are quite excellent. I first heard the ""No Quarter"" cover on a college radio station, driving about midnight on the Illinois-Missouri border. It turned a dark, dimly-lit, desolate drive into an ethereal experience.It's also neat to feel the growth toward Lateralus, with songs becoming less angry (as on Aenima) and more pondering, more inward-looking."
0,horrible!,I use to love this movie! Definately does NOT stand the test of time. I bought for my husband to watch with me and I gotta say I was embarrasred that i picked it.
1,Johnny Tremain,"I have used this movie in mySocial Studies classes on theAmerican Revolution. My movie is a little worn and now I hve both video and VHS,"
0,"Not just bad, dangerous!","The frame mount for this product is just plain dangerous. It does not hold the lock securely in place and the lock will work free while cycling. This very thing happened to me. Fortunately, the lock only bounced off of my shin, causing pain but not a crash. It seems that retailers (and presumably BullDOg) are aware of this and yet let this inherently dangerous condition continue. I do not even bother using the mount any more.As for the lock itself, after 3 months, the locking mechanism is jammed. The key often does not work. I think the tumblers become misaligned. I have tried wiggling it, shaking it, finessing it, striking it, etc. nothing works. Then, a day or so later, it works again. Again, having read reviews (unfortunately AFTER purchase) it appears that the company is aware of this defect. BullDog is BullCr@p!"
1,One of the greatest Books ever written,"This book is a great piece of writing, especially concidering that the writer does not specialize in books, but in wrestling. I, myself, am an avid wrestling fan and a Mick Foley fan but I believe that non wrestling fans will share the same opinion as I about this book. It goes in detail about Mr. Foley's childhood and how he rose against all odds to become one of the greatest wrestlers ever. He has sacraficed himself to many times not to deserve everyone's respect."
1,Not what i expected,"After reading Fight Club, Choke, Invisible Monsters, and Survivor, Lullaby caught me off guard, it didn't strike me as something Chuck would write about;it was out there, like most of his work that i've read is,but best of all, it was an exellent read and definitely up to par with the rest of his works;i can't wait to see the day that he's required reading in schools,his work is far more interesting and makes me think independantly alot more than anything i've ever read before.brilliant"
0,Blu-Ray Incorrect Aspect Ratio and Cropped,"This is one of my most disappointing blu-ray purchases ever. As you can readily see from multiple sources, this film was shot 1.37:1, or ""full frame"" in 1953. It should NEVER be shown in 1.78:1 widescreen as it is on this blu-ray, because that requires cropping material from the top and/or bottom of the image (as you can readily see from the bonus materials, which were shot years ago and contain footage in the correct aspect ratio). It also means the image is magnified and exhibits huge amounts of film grain that result in a very soft image in many shots. Frankly, it's hard for a film instructor to believe a major studio would violate a film in this way. If you don't want to see the top of John Wayne's hat or people's legs everytime you're supposed to, go ahead and buy this blu-ray. Otherwise, seek out the excellent previous DVD release. The bonus features are the same and the image is all there."
1,GOOD 'EVIL' FUN,"Steve Carell, and Jason Segel are excellent as the world's once greatest supervillain, and his supplanter in this hilarious, sometimes sophomoric, but never boring story of twisted aspirations, and unintended redemption. Normally the rule of thumb in movies is that kids, and dogs usually steal any scene they're in, regardless of whether acting is required- not so here. Little, round, googly-eyed, often inept, overtly clumsy, yellow critters, otherwise known as minions almost eliminate the need for a script. Julie Andrews as Carell's less-than-caring mom is also quite wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of 3-D, but DESPICABLE ME uses it well. Great, silly fun, with very decent animation. It might be a bit scary for the very young."
0,Waaayyyyyy too expensive!,Seriously??? $12.00 for ONE pound of candy PLUS $11.00 to ship ONE pound?? Scott's Cakes - at these prices you will not be in business for long! :-(
1,Nice Product,"I've only used this product once so far, but it has every feature I'm looking for. It fits great, has plenty of loops for lenses, bottles, even another camera."
0,They didn't know what to do with this one,"Babe: Pig in the City is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It was strange, and creepy, and not like the first Babe at all. Being a fan of its predecessor, I thought I would like this one, but it was very disappointing. A couple gross parts with Mrs. Hoggett, some with the animals and neighbors. Yuck. I give it 2 stars because there were a couple (and ONLY a couple) funny parts. But don't watch this movie unless you want a letdown!"
1,Good Movies - 3 Comedies in 1 DVD Case !,These movies are funny & I liked them when I watched them...I got this dvd set for my nephew. I recommend these movies to folks.
1,great,"we bought it for a kids sleep over and they seemed to enjoy this movie, it arrived quickly to our home"
1,One of the Best of Its Kind,"This was my first stats book in college. I really liked it a lot, and maybe it is why it helped me appreciate stats. This book is very versatile and somehow explains sophisticated concepts with the greatest of ease. It has great examples, and I learn better with those. This book was used not only in my undergrad courses (Stats I and II, back mid-'70's) but also in my MBA curriculum (as a later edition) 10 years later. I have yet to run into a better book for someone studying stats for the first time. Also good at probability, which is one of the most obtuse, counter-intuitive subjects for humans to understand."
1,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Such a clever cast and a wickedly funny movie!! A little slow in the beginning, but it sets you up to understand and really feel the movie later on."
0,Dreadful. Did not finish!,"I think that this is one of the creepiest books, that is rife with the smarmiest charactures, that I have read. It got so confusing, and so disgusting that I almost got through, but I just couldn't make it. Save your money. If you must have it, get it used."
1,Pleasantly surprised,We got this because it was the cheapest double high queen inflatable we could find with decent reviews. The documentation states it's for indoor use only but we actually took this camping which worked fine. While plenty thick and durable I'd say it does seem slightly more fragile than ones made for the outdoors. If you're going to take this same route you'll need to have a way to provide AC power to it. In our case we just used an inverter connected to the car and a long extension cord.
1,Outstanding Guided Support!,"I like self-help books, quizzes, scorecards and introspection, so most books fall in the 'interesting' category. This one is in the WOW category! I committed to the 49 week program and kept going through the exercises that made me roll my eyes and say 'seriously?'... but you know what? IT WORKS!!! The transformation is from within, the pain gets healed by having an understanding heart and a willing mind. Calling in The ONE.. is a secret... you are not calling in someone else... you are calling in your own heart and giving it permission to be with you all ways... and there is nothing more powerful than that.. I guarantee it!"
1,Great Beck,"Enough can't be said about the amazingly cheap sound this CD has. When I bought it the only Beck I had heard was Odelay, Mutations and Midnite Vultures and was more or less shocked at the quality of recording. It was recorded (probably on a 4-track) in a basement and sounds like it. That being said, this is a great album full of all the great, heartfelt, weird lyrics and creative instrumentation that marks Beck as a musical genius. Any Beck fan should have this CD if for nothing more than background to his later greater works. If you're not a Beck fan, you'd be better advised to grab a more ""made for mainstream"" album with curbed edges like Odelay or Midnite Vultures for an introductory album."
1,Blast from the Past,"I am an oldie but goodie myself. I have all of his albums on LP, yes, LP's, and am trying, little by little to replace all of my lp's with CD's. This is one of the finest albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Leon Russell truly rocks. I think this album is the best of all his albums."
0,disappointed,I found this production dreary and uninspired. The soundtrack was extremely unpleasant and distracting.
1,hi lift,this lifts very well with 30 v. no bleaching is required and it comes out very bright on lighter hair. also it does no leave hair dry and damaged like normal bleach and add dye routines
1,Excellent story for people to relate to!,"In having read this book, I can only say that I was touched deeply by Julia's fight to gain her life after going through horrible life events. She tells a great tale and she has some great tips for those of us who desire to lose weight. So, thank you for a heartwarmer, Julia. This is a good addition to any library."
1,"A bit more mild than I hoped, but still hugely refreshing","Here's the problem: I love green tea and all the health benefits, but I can't deal with caffeine after about 3pm. So what to do?This tea does the trick! It's really tasty, if a bit lacking in bite, and I'm confident it's quite good for me. I'm now drinking this instead of my multiple glasses of water in the afternoon :)"
0,That's it...,"After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further."
0,You would have to be stupid to buy this.,A smart person would buy a CompactFlash card and avoid the problems of a spinning platter that is sure to fail.
0,Black & white,"I ordered this thinking it would be in color. For over $14 I would expect it. I should have sent it back. Never watched it since it was black and white movie. If I could get my money back now, I would. I was just too busy to deal with sending it back. I won't ever make that mistake again.Very disappointed"
0,NOT ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!??,"just checked out darkshadowsdvd.com, to find this set is August and September 1967 ONLY!!! set 2, was June and July 1967, ONLY!....WHAT A JIP!!! And these sets are going to be released Quarterly, with only (2) months of shows!!!....Why not just release ALL episodes AT ONCE!!! UGHHHHHHHHHH!!! I'm thinking about CANCELLING my pre-order of collection 3. Dan Curtis is a JIP-Master!!!"
0,worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purshased this product to replace a microwave rice cooker by the same company but a smaller version. The smaller one worked extremely well and since i was sure of their reliability i decided to buy the bigger version. I was disappointed - it is made of cheap plastic and the design is flawed . The cooking water overflows and everytime i cook rice i have to clean out the turntable- at least half a cup of water overflows. Good for steaming veggies but not for rice or pasta.
1,Still the easiest and best by far,"Powerquest and again created a great partition program. It is extremely easy to use whether you know anything about hard drives or not it doesn't matter. Everything is wizard based and askes you if you will install another operating system just using it for data which operating system you are using, everything you could thing when you want to partition your hard drive. This is the only program that i have used to partition my hard drive and wasn't worried about my data. This is BY FAR the best. Its quick too"

1,An Amazing DVD to go with some Amazing guys :),"Sister Hazel has talent. Not only do they have some talent but they are unbelievably nice, funny, adventurous, quirky, everything. The dvd, A Day in the Life, delves deep into their lives and shows what real, true people they are. They aren't some stuck up band who doesn't have time for their fans. They stay after their shows and even cook hot dogs with them in their bakery hats!!! haha...Not only is there a full-length documentary on the dvd, but there's also a full concert with favorites such as ""Champagne High, Your Winter, and All For You."" They also have bonuses of Champagne High among other things. Keep a look out for this dvd b/c it's going fast!!!"
0,Horrible experience - do not buy this,"Simply stated - this product just isn't compatible with XP. Even if it installs correctly it will fail after a period of the player sitting idle or the player batteries running down.Technical support is a joke, they have a ""customer is always wrong attitude"" if you can reach them.This thing may, or may not, work for you but I don't recommend taking the risk."
0,Printer Jams from Day 1,"I originally ordered the product for my daughter. After setting it up, it jammed the first try I made a printout. Sad to say, not even one printout came out. I have had several printers already, but this one really sucks. Worse, the store I bought it from will not allow a refund once you already opened the box. Worse more is that the ink toner I bought with the printer cannot be returned unless I prepaid the shipping cost. Avoid this printer at all cost."
0,Disappointing,"For the price I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, but I really can't even use his thermometer. Checking visually for doneness is about as reliable. It takes so long for the temperature to register that the food loses heat while you are checking its temperature, and if it is not done then it just has to cook longer because it takes over a minute for the needle to register 160 degrees."
0,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"I saw this movie in the Fresh Meadows, NY movie theater in 1986, I believe. So I was only 15 years old. But I thought this movie was awful and the acting was terrible. I remember some guy asking, ""Where are me bloody wheels?!"" throughout the whole movie. At least I didn't pay for it since we used to break into the theater's back door."
0,Nice While It Lasted,"This shredder worked pretty much as it said it would in the literature. It is a step up from the low end ""personal"" shredders that can only take a few pages at a time and can't run very long without needing to rest.Aside from a basket that filled pretty quickly (you have to redistribute the shredded paper as it naturally forms a heap right below the blades), it did the job for me.But here I am 17 months later and it is semi-dead; it only runs in reverse and the operating lights are dim. I'm past the one-year warranty and only the blades are warranted for longer than that. It just dropped dead out of the blue and definitely wasn't overused. For a shredder that cost close to $100 I expect a LOT longer operating life."
1,Better than Lateralus,"While my review for Lateralus was very sarcastic, I truly believe that Aenima is a masterpiece. It has all the rage from Undertow without sounding too over-the-top and is has the right amount of ""artiness"" without sounding like it's trying too hard to be smart. Hopefully the new album coming in 2006 will not be at all like Lateralus."
1,"Living in Oregon, a great Latino Writer",Living in Oregon is a great Latino writer whose dreams are America. Amazing grace! Absolutely perfect from opening word to closing sentence.
1,Outstanding Entry,"This is an outstanding entry in Saylor's Gordianus series. Of all the novels so far, this is the one I remember most vividly. The setting of Massilia comes to life: the streets, the homes, the Mediterranean beneath the steep cliffs. The characters and their secrets and sufferings are memorable and Saylor does a seamless job of weaving in historical information so that, unlike in a few of the earlier books, it flows as part of plot and setting and doesn't jar. Hieronymus, who serves the official role of Scapegoat, is an example of historic information made live and interesting.During the entire story, Gordianus is searching for news of his adopted son, Meto, who, rumors say, is dead. He has with him his son-in-law, Davus, whose size serves as a deterrent to those who might wish to harm Gordianus. This book gives us a picture of Roman times, the extended Roman family, life in the ""provinces,"" military plotting, agony, revenge and, maybe, justice. Definitely worth reading."
0,Head in the Sand,"This is a wonderful book for children if you want boys to think it is their right to abuse girls and for girls to think they have to endure abuse in order to be accepted. It teaches boys that to withhold affection is the key to success. I really can't believe that a female wrote this book, as it is about as blatantly chauvinistic and ""old school thinking"" as I have read in years. Children are impressionable by what they see on television and what they read; to think otherwise is having your head buried in the sand. This book does not portray acceptable behavioral patterns for people of any age."
0,Wouldn't buy a Canon ever again,"I bought this camera at the birth of my daughter, when I did, I thought that I would at least have a camera to take pictures of her growing up for quite a few years (especially since I paid $400. when it now came out). Little did I know that it would only give me a couple years.When I press the shutter button to take a picture, it (the display) gets dark and an underexposed picture results. When I wrote Canon I was told that it is a problem with the camera and that it would cost in the region of $200. to repair.This camera was treated exceptionally well and was used by myself alone, I even bought a Samsonite camera bag from inception. I therefore know that the fault is a manufacturer's defect. But since the camera is past the warranty period, I'll have to pay. I understand that the warranty is up, but I will NEVER again buy a Canon camera since it doesn't last long."
0,Nice looking but a wobbly,"This cane arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.The pros: comfortable, seemingly durable foam handle; it's easy to adjust for different heights; nice color and finish.The con (and it's a big one): it's slightly wobbly. If you place it flat on the ground and apply slight pressure to the handle, it wobbles as though one foot is slightly shorter than the other three. Upon closer examination, that was exactly the case! I went to a local drugstore to look at others. Maybe is was suppose to be that way, I thought. However, the quad canes I found at RiteAid were much more stable. Their legs were all of even length. I read a similar complaint about this a Duro-Med cane so I can't help but wonder if this company is trying to unload the canes that weren't manufactured properly."
0,Running out of steam,"After reading ASSASINS and all its LEFT BEHIND precursers, I've noticed a trend toward decreasing quality as the saga continues. Let me say that all of these Judgment Day novels--LEFT BEHIND series, THE VISITATION, etc., none of them can hold a candle to the nerve-racking suspense and realism of the true End Time classic of them all, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. THE LAST DAY remains the high water mark against which I measure any such attempts, and all of these have proven weak disappointments, in comparison."

0,Best of the 3.5 books,"This happens to be the best of the 3.5 core books. Unfortunately, this isn't saying much. Wait for official errata and/or a 2nd printing."
0,Not a Documentary.,"This is not a ""documentary"" at all. It's an infomercial, made by a conspiracy theory filmmaker (his past credits include the 9/11 truther movie ZEITGEIST; under his assumed name ""Eric Clinton""), made to promote the evil doings of a notorious quack. Neither director Merola nor doctor Burzynski have shown any compunction about lying in the past, so why trust them now?Also, as a movie, it's so very boring. Snore."

1,"when being kind & loving was considered ""class""","where, today, can a person watch a movie, filled with fun, where actors are kind to each other while playing at intolerance? the scene where Shirley and her squirrely protectors break out and into a rowdy rendition of an operatic aria was heartrendering. the director was a man with a very big heart sure,it is a simplistic plot and all that but it beats the hell out of anything hollywood and it's sex and violence crazed producers will ever be able create."
1,"Gorgeous Pictures, Not-So-Great Writing Quality","Fun books for their illustrations and not their writing quality, the Billy and Blaze series were always at the top of my list growing up. They smack of great wild west adventures and the fun that can be had on horseback.Although poorly written, the Billy and Blaze series was fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination. Any young horse lovers will eat up the vivid black and white drawings that tell the quaint stories much more eloquently than the rather dry words.To read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."
1,So Very Impressed,I have never been this impressed with a product. I love the fact that I can read for hours and my hands don't hurt. When my eyes get tired I can change the print size to rest them. I love it. I can't find anything wrong with it. If you read as much as I do ( 2 to 3 books a week) this product is for you. I have so many books in storage it makes my family shudder to think about it. I wish the Kindle had been invented years ago. I read many of the reviews and the problems that I read were no problem to me or easily solved. I would rate this a 10 star if there were 10...
0,Not a Fan,"I remember watching the Smurfs every Saturday morning and how much I loved it. Once I received the DVD I popped it in but was disappointed, just wasn't a good as I remembered. I also feel that the picture quality wasn't that good either, I realize this is an old show but with all the technology they have these days it shouldn't look so old."

0,It blew up this evening,"I've had my RX-D202B for about a month now and, up to this point, it has worked very nicely. I came home this evening to watch a DVD on my new plasma TV with full digital surround-sound via this receiver/amp, but when I turned it on there was a bright blue flash from inside the right rear of the cabinet, and now it refuses to power on, even after I've tried everything I could think of to reset it. Its power is filtered through a surge protector, it hadn't been turned on all day prior to that, and I've verified (by meter and by hooking up my old surround-sound system) that the speakers and speaker wiring are not shorted, so I have no explanation for this behavior. I suspect a fuse has blown, but the cabinet is designed (and the warning labels sufficiently alarming) so that opening it up to look inside seems contraindicated. I'll know more after I take it in for warranty service, but I'm a bit skeptical of this thing right at the moment."
0,Not Great.,"I picked up this album simply because it was a sequel to the first Zen CD. If I had to use two words to describe this set they would be ""Not Great."" The first cd in the set starts out with some semi-decent drum and bass but quickly degenerates into, well, I don't know what. It's sort of like a lame trance album that's trying to double as a soundtrack for an 80's movie. I really couldn't get into it. Stick with the first album..."
0,Nice look - Not-so-nice feel,"I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not ""wick away moisture."" The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors."
0,A disappointment,"I purchased this book anticipating the same variety of projects the previous 15 books in the series offer. I was disappionted. Most of the projects in this book use beads, ribbon, and candles. There are no cross stitch projects, no papercrafts such as scherenschnitte or paper twist, no child friendly crafts section. I understand that there are trends in crafting, but the appeal of the previous books in the series was the spectrum of projects, and decorating motifs. The decorating ideas in this book are mainly elegant, fancy, victorian. Using similar ideas in different color schemes. None of which I would consider child friendly."
1,In recognition of a fellow traveler,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I travelled in a similar way though Asia in my twenties and would love to do the same thing in Europe. I liked the combination of travelogue and introspection. I'm a big fan of Freya Stark's books too so I enjoyed the author's discovery of her writing. I'm going to read Janet Flanner's writing now.
1,another great bond movie,"the only movie by lazenby,Australian actor, as apparently women cast did not enjoy working with him, plenty of action,chasing,bullets, another great Bond movie, i am big James Bond fan, loved it."
1,A dream cookbook,"I don't like to cook and use slow cookers whenever possible, and needed to go low-carb (the only way I've ever lost weight), so this was a no-brainer. To my delight I've found lots of good recipes, and was so impressed I sent a copy to my sister and roommate who live on low-carb, too. They have been so delighted they use this book almost exclusively, and have served guests who liked the food and had no idea it was low-carb. How nice is that???"
1,Awesome,I have enjoyed listening to this CD. There is a great selection of Willie Nelson's songs on this awesome CD.
1,one of the greatest albums of 90's,i have owned this cd for years and it still hasn't gotten old. i love blink 182 and i don't understand why people keep putting the band down. this album is sarcastic and funny and simply rocks. if i could i would fill the page with stars.
0,yuck,"that is about all I can say about this. I was intrigued to buy this because I couldn't find any reviews. The cover has Jack, Mark Long, and Lee I Min all over it. The pictures are from Unbeaten 28 and 7 grandmasters. Well, with Lung Fei's name all over this box, I was hoping I wasn't buying a movie I already had. Nope, this one is just like the back of the dvd says, Lee I min vs. Lung Fei. And while Lee I min was ok in this, I thought it was one of his worst performances. On the other hand, I thought this one of lung fei's better showings. Add in another kid with a stupid hair do, and you have an alright action movie. But then the story is oh so dreadful, this is defintely in my big pile of crap that will be sold at the used store here pretty soon.the picture quality is bad and is full screened. A coupel of times teh vhs tape they were recording from completely flutters out. Enjoy."
0,Only after you've read everything else,"This is a hard core conservative's dream book of truth. Hard core liberals will read it to make them feel superior. Unfortunately it's just a bad book that seems to have been, literally, thrown together. Repitition and bad editing are evident throughout.The first 2 chapters about early calls and the probable effect on voting nationwide are pretty interesting. Not only is the case laid out pretty well but the topic has never been widely covered. No doubt because the people who caused the problem are the one's who would have to do the covering.After these chapters, it's pretty much the same formula over and over. Gore, and almost everybody who worked for his campaign, are vile swill. Bush, and the Bushies, are honest, fearless, etc. While undoubtedly true, it gets boring and really not worth reading."
1,good movie,"I recommend this product cause' is something a little different of what the horror movies offer, the drama is well written, even though there's some issues with effects and some irregularities with reality adaptation, but hey what movie in this world is perfect."
0,Perhaps You Get What You Pay For?,"Although Ms. Peschel's book is indeed affordable, the information contained within it's covers may not be entirely accurate or useful beyond a somewhat superficial context. This book does not touch on any of the very important aspects of runic lore that are inextricably connected to the mythos of the Northmen or the creation concepts that are also very much central to the workings of runic energies, both in divination and magick. What's more, it does not endeavor to go beyond the outward manifestations of runic forces, leaving the reader somewhat lacking in understanding of the actual workings of the Wyrd. Also, as a word of caution, using this book as a guide for rune magick could prove to be more harmful than useful as well. Perhaps the book could be useful to a true beginner, although I would be more inclined to recommend Tony Willis' book as a preferable alternative."
0,Closed Captioning does not work!,"I am profoundly deaf and I bought The Business of Being Born DVD which is supposed to have Closed Captioning as stated on the DVD box. It does not have the subtitles features. When I tried to play it on 3 different televisions, it would not work! I am very disappointed for I am not able to watch it without understanding! I don't know why the Closed Captioning doesn't work? Maybe because it was used and it malfunctioned? I only watched 15 minutes and could not understand anything so I have this DVD which I am not able to watch! (frown)"
0,This software is the worst that I have ever used!,"It's funny, I'm actually a CPA who specializes in tax compliance. I usually use Lacerte software from Intuit, but I moved and had to finish my partnership at home. I bought TaxCut, and I figured that it would be fine since I'm familiar with taxes. I was wrong, it was full of problems, very difficult to navigate your way around. The partners capital didn't generate to the K-1's correctly. I finally got it all worked out, but it was a pain, especially for an easy partnership. Anyway, I'll be going to TurboTax for everything next year. They have always been better to me."
0,Disappointed,I was looking for basic beginner help and better diagrams.It wasn't as helpful as I was expecting since I am a beginner.I would say this book would be for someone that has crocheted for some time.

1,Lacks the spark of the original,"No doubt Dunne is an excellent technician, but he lacks the Flatley's viceral charisma with the audience and his chemistry with Butler. The spark and excitement of the original is missing. On the up side, it's still a wonderful performance (even if a bit overedited), and the DVD format with surround sound is fabulous. I only wish the version with Flatley was available in the same format."

1,Need more tech than investment savvy,"This book came to me highly recommended by a friend and I read it in no time at all, very well presented and very readable. The only thing is to get the most out of it you need to have a lot of tech knowledge. I work for an e-business consultancy and I found the idea of picking the basket of stocks in a potential Gorilla industry a bit of an intimidating task. However, it does point out you can make a lot of cash from investing later in the game as it becomes more obvious who the key player is, this is probably a better approach than the one they advocate for most people."
0,they don't ship what is shown in the picture,"I also looking for a three tray system, but when the package arrived I discovered they don't ship what is shown. Turns out this is a single tray and you have to spend 3 times more to get what is in the photo!I personally recommend this one instead: Sparco 90206 3-Tier Steel Mesh Desk Tray, Black (Link: www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAXL7I/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01)"
1,"Delicious, organic and such a steal!","I usually get these for my 29 month old son at the local store for 35 cents each and he LOVES them. When he expressed an interest in them, it was expensive to keep buying them at the store, I found them on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. The price is really great for a organic product and I feel good giving my son these pops knowing that they are 100% natural, made with only real fruit extracts with no chemical dyes and no corn syrup. They are packed with favor, my son takes a few licks and gives them back to me which I save for later. The container is super convenient, once the pops run out I'll just buy the bulk pack. There were very few broken pops, the broken ones I put in my purse and use them as cough drops. I highly recommend them."
0,Good music,It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
1,Easy to use,This was simple to set up and use. This is my second Smart Strip and each one has been a simple replacement to my prior strips. In my case they worked out of the box with no need to make an adjustment (as is apparently required in some circumstances). Would have given it 5 stars but don't yet know the impact on my power use. Will be purchasing a third for my desktop computer
1,Another Response to UCLA Student,"Di Stefano is generally recognized as having hands-down one ofthe most beautiful tenor voices in history, perhaps ranking in the topthree. His singing on this CD, though a bit past his prime, still displays a purity and beauty of timbre rarely matched in today's best tenors. Anyone who would describe Di Stefano's voice as ""ordinary"" does not know the first thing about singing. Di Stefano's voice has a velvety richness and melting sweetness that is instantly recognizable by even the least knowledgeable of opera fans."
0,Flimsy,"very thin slats, if i were to touch it before buying it i would have never bought it, well maybe for 5 bucks"
0,bad quality recording,"The workout itself is fine, pleasantly structured like a class yet doable at home without a barre. However, the recording is terrible--80's style and grainy, off colors, horrid sound with twangy, strung-out notes much like an old turn of the last century silent film. MUCH better are NYC Ballet workouts 1 and 2: Stunning visually, high quality, great workout."
1,Pretty good,I liked the series better. It had a good story and expanded a little to what has happened since the series ended
0,Disappointed,"I purchased these on June 27th and, unfortunately I did not open the box and start using them until late July. Within 1/2 days, the left side went out, and just the right side works. When I went online to see about returning them, it was out of the time frame and according to the warranty(which I admit to not reading before purchasing), even if I was in the allotted time slot, would only be eligible for 50% of my money back. Sigh. Word to the wise, open electronics immediately!!!"

0,It lasted a whole week!,Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be a real Timex product. Maybe it is to be considered a disposable item? Ours broke when my son brushed his teeth and got his hands wet. Hopefully they aren't all that sensitive.
0,Categorically inferior to the 1976 original in every conceivable way.,"The remake of the 1976 classic ""The Omen"" is categorically inferior in every conceivable way to the original. Perhaps the most glaring discrepancy is with the acting. In particular, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were outstanding in their respective roles as Mr. and Mrs. Robert Thorn...you simply do not have this caliber of acting in the remake. For all intents and purposes, the remake of ""The Omen"" fails to stack up to the original. In fact, the remake almost follows the original movie in every way with a few minor deviations and superfluous additions, but the problem is that the original did it perfectly the first time around so there was no way to improve upon the original. Still, it's a great story and is probably worth viewing if you have any interest in the subject matter. However, with that being said, I highly recommend the original over this inferior remake."
0,"Who wrote this, really?","Let me begin by saying that I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card. His books are thought-provoking, intelligent, and insightful.This is precisely what leads me to conclude that Card could not have written this book. It's just bad. The author understands little about politics, the media, or even religion. This was written by some right-wing hack who flunked out of the English department at Princeton, and thinks it was because of a liberal conspiracy, rather than because of his lack of ability to write or think.The portrayal of Islam is straight out of the Fox News handbook, and bears no resemblance to the balanced way Card has treated other religious views in his writing. Card's complex understanding of the nature of power (see Ender's Game) is nowhere evidenced in this book. This is much more Ann Coulter than Card."

1,Wonderful.,"Yes it is small, however the size is clearly stated in other listings so the size should not be a mystery, also a tiny bit goes a long way.I like this so much that I just ordered another one, except this time I wanted to try the Amber Butter.I've used amber resin for years, and I wanted to give this a try. This is a winner, and I will purchase these 'butters' in the future as opposed to the resins.This is a great product having a wonderful long lasting aroma, and the shipping from Tom's was very fast, shipped out within one day's time.I love it when purchases such as this turn out so well."
0,Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest,"The exterior of the Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest was in good condition. However, the slide-out drawer would not work. I finally got it loose and the wood was raw and untreated in order to make it slide. I had to wax all of the surfaces that the drawer contacted. It still didn't slide very smoothly, but I kept the chest.I'm wondering if these items are ""seconds"", and hesitate to order from vendors through Amazon.com"
1,double bass,I like this video. There are a few drum solos and demos. The tips they gave you made double bass not so impossible. It helped motivate my students.
0,"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back","Friends have the top-mounted iTrip and they work great, so I figured that I would get the new iTrip to use with my 30Gig 5G iPod. It looks good and the mode of operation is simple. The normal USB port on the bottom is a nice touch and it appears that Griffin looked at how people were modding their itrips to boost signal strength and moved the antennae outside of the case to improve reception. It seems that in doing this that they turned DOWN the signal strength to compensate - therefore, it seems to work way worse than the older iTrips. Also, the one station that works in Boston - 87.9, which is an option on the older iTrips is no longer available on this newer one. TOTALLY LAME. If I had not chopped the thing up to increase the length of the antennae, I would have brought this thing back. A waste of money."
1,new horse,"I like this book because it tells if your looking for a new horse what not to look for. It's easy to relate to problems like this, and not just with horses, but with friends. It's also got a surpising ending. I rate this book five stars."
0,What happened to Hot Wheels??,"When I was a kid I had Hot Wheels, Matchbox, and track to go with them. You could buy speed sets, launchers, loops, AND strips of track. But now it seems the only way you can get track is in a set and that is it. And only a few styles of cars really work well with the motorized pusher. No chance for my kid come up with her own design. No need to be creative. The manufacturers have taken the fun out of it and told kids to watch the cars go around and around and around and around and around, but don't bother laying track out from the top of thier dresser to the bed to the floor, hit the loop, and launch across the room."
0,webkinz yorkie,"My son wanted this pet because is was the ""webkinz of the month."" I read the reviews which were not good but he insisted on it anyway. As the other reviewers stated the the animal was matted and unattractive and the hair was permenently stuck to eyes"
1,Excellent book,I was studying wave propagation in anisotropic media from this book on my advisor's recommendation. I do not have a physics background but a mechanics background. This book was very helpful for me to understand the basic concept. I was surprised to see this book was out of print.
0,Tiresome!,"This book starts out in a very promising manner--good storyline, interesting situation, an intriguing main character. About halfway through, though, the story gets predictable & dull, the main character (Joop) becomes a cardboard cutout of a despicable human being who lives only for his own passion for making chocolate, and the story just goes downhill. I started skimming quickly through the book just to see how it ended. The book just ends, leaving you with a bad taste in you mouth. Chocolate shouldn't do that! This book could have been excellent if the level of writing had continued throughout & the author had not reverted to stereotypical characters and a plodding plot line. Maybe next time!"
0,Typical Hollywood pulp,"Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me."
0,Quit after maybe 10 uses,I have had this product for less than a year and ised it less than a dozen times. I thought this skillet was okay. Didn't like the noise each time it heated. But last night it would not brown the tenderloin medallions at 450 degrees. I guess with a 30 day return policy I'm stuck. I thought I would like not worrying about immersing this skillet. I washed by hand never in a sink of water. Can't recommend this product.
1,About as good as they get.,"A lot of people when they flat just throw the tube away never trusting to patches. I have done the same but I still carry a patch kit because if a my spare fails, I've can either repair the patch or walk. Besides the patch kit is relatively small and weighs almost nothing. I have experimented with the patches and they are about as good as you'll find. They are relatively large and the the glue works pretty well. I also carry a very small squeeze vial of 91% rubbing alcohol to clean the are of tire talc to improve the changes for a quality seal.I would have given this kit 5 stars but as with most patch kit, the tube of glue is too small. I'd pay slightly more if they provided two tubes."
0,You get what you pay for...,"This was the first flat iron I ever owned. It worked ok, but it pulled my hair. That hurt! I have thick hair and it takes a while to straighten it. Friends were telling me Chi was the best. Well, I finally bought one. What a difference! Yes, the Chi is over $100, but it's the best! I got my hair done in half the time the Revlon one took. Plus, the Chi heated up in one minute and did not pull my hair. The Chi gets my hair straighter, faster. And my hair feels so silky after using the Chi."

0,Maybe I got a bad one but......,"Just bought this product today for pure phone use. I plugged the main unit in an outlet and ran the phone cord. I then put the extension unit in another room and plugged in the phone. It worked perfectly! About 30 minutes later I went to use the phone and there was no dial tone. I did the reset, etc. The troubleshooting guide said that this could be caused by the phones being to far from each other. To test this I moved the extension unit to an outlet very close to the main unit. At first it worked. But then again after a few minutes no dial tome again. Both units have a solid red light. Right now its packed back up and will be returned to Target tomorrow. If you buy it I hope your luck is better than mine."
0,The cover is very decieving,"It shows what looks to be an emotional, beautiful epic movie...WRONG! The acting could not have been worse, even the big name actors looked like low-budget wannabes, the movie plods along at an excruciatingly slow, confusing pace and just does not make sense anywhere along the way. I could not see what was so great about the so-called 'witch' woman, nor any of the men that were lusting after her. After about 45 minutes of this train wreck my husband and I could not put up with anymore. Avoid this one at all costs. I'm glas I rented it as a two for one deal, but I still feel cheated."

1,Full of Useful Information But Needs an Editor,"This book is full of useful information and strategies for active traders and investors. However, it is poorly written. The author repeats himself often, while omitting important information that I guess he assumes the reader knows (for example that the mark to market election can only be changed once chosen with the specific consent of the IRS). Sections and subheadings are poorly organized. Often the author writes something like: ""we recommend X for the following reasons"" and no reasons follow. The book desperately needs editing. If you are prepared to put up with this and have a good understanding of the basics of the tax code as they apply to investing already then this book is very worthwhile reading. I am just starting Ted Tesser's book on taxes for traders. It is a MUCH better read. I have yet to see if it is as useful."

1,Nobody but Buechner can write like this,"Yet again Buechner displays his amazing wisdom though an ingenious little book that is easy to read (even one a day if you like) and yet hard to put down. If you've read and enjoyed ""Wishful Thinking: A Seeker's Dictionary"", then this ""Whistling in the Dark: ABC Theologized"" is a must-have. If you haven't read either - get them! You'll never see a more even-handed, honest, and insightful take on religion and life as we know it."
1,Installed and used it with no problems,"I installed this unit in a win XP Home system. It was easily installed and worked on the first task. The software package is apparantly a nonSony package. The Instructions for loading and setup seemed to be good. However, what the software represents is another thing. I can't help wondering if it self destructs after a short time. I did not understand what the points of the two systems were, but I am sure if one buys a system, they should, unless clearly warned otherwise, get the tools that will make the unit functional. At this point I am not sure that Sony has provided me with durable software. The only note is ""easy to use feature rich software"". The MP3 feature is certainly only a trial. The remainder may have been lost in an asian electronic translator."

1,Computer Tips & Snarks at Their Finest,"Dan Tynan's Computer Privacy Annoyances is sharp and smart, full of tips and oozing with snark that makes for non-stop reading fun. Considering the subject matter, that's pretty astonishing.The Net is so convenient that we don't like to think beyond running anti-spyware and keeping our AV's and firewalls up to date. The why of doing these things raises the blood pressure -- but here, you can learn while being entertained. It's one of those actual win-win situations you so rarely hear about.What impressed me most, though, is that Tynan is so thorough that he mentions dangers to avoid that I hadn't thought of on my own. O'Reilly books are generally excellent resources and this one shines in particular."
0,"Skip this CD, unless you're into depression.","First let me state I had never heard of Mr. Bernard until I saw his cd in the rack. I purchased the cd based on the music description on the cover of the cd itself. It sounded promising as I am a fan of blues/funk/jazz guitar music (j.golub, r. cray, etc.). No doubt about Mr Bernard's virtuosity is there, but this cd is overshadowed by a darkness of sound that is cast over the entire the cd. There are not any light moments here. The hammond organ sound completely wipes out the lead instrument of Mr Bernard. I was beginning wonder whose album this was any way. The organ dominates instead of accompanying the guitar. Looking forward to the next cd by Mr Bernard though, as there is something about his playing (as little as was heard) that is appealing. Wait til then unless you're into the darkness of the hammond organ as presented here. Later."
0,Cover sucks,"I didnt like it from the moment i put it on. Poor fit, horrible belt buckle with an impossible to find clip.

0,Fell on it's face,"What was the point of Falling Down? If you can answer that question, you win the jackpot. OK, so Michael Douglas's character had a meltdown and is supposedly sticking up for the rights of the consumer. To think someone could go through L.A shooting up fast food restaurants and scaring away gang members twice your size with a bat just doesn't make any sense. I don't care if it is Hollywood. You still have to make logical sense. There were way to many coincidences. Things just did not add up at certain parts in the movie. The acting was good, but of course, what do you expect from Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall? I thought the background music was terrific though. It contributed to the movie in appropriate ways, and I think it is what kept this movie from sticking to the fan. Overall, Falling Down is a huge disappointment that has really no point to it. 2 Stars"
1,"Reading Zagreb, Exit South","This short novel is simultaneously funny and sad. In modern-day Croatia, the characters have no idea how to seek happiness in their post-traumatic stress syndrome lives. They foolishly seek it through alcohol, sex, and dysfunctional relationships. While their lives seem largely meaningless and pathetic, and Baba and Vera in particular need to take communication lessons from Marshall Rosenberg, the reader nonetheless manages to sympathize with them and hopes that they make some progress."

1,Diamond in Disguise,"After listening to John Fred's soulful and passionate vocals on ""Absolutely the Best"", it only goes to prove that both John and the Playboy Band were truly one of the most underrated groups in rock and roll history. Although ""Judy in Disguise"" was the song that established the group on the charts, this CD proves to the listener that Top 40 radio missed the mark in showcasing John's wide array of talent not only as a songwriter, but mainly as a vocalist. On ""She Shot A Hole In My Soul"" and ""Sad Story"", John's vocals are reminiscent of the legendary Otis Redding. The Playboy Band also displays some top-notch backup with everything from trumpets to organ. My only disappointment with ""Absolutely The Best"" is that the group's final entry on the charts, ""Hey, Hey Bunny"" wasn't included."
0,"O.K. Case, But Could Be Better","The only reason I got this case was because Handspring was offering it free when you bought the Visor Deluxe. It is really well made, but doesn't seem to quite fit the Visor. The case is a little to small to close tightly over the screen. Because I tend to drop my Visor into my purse or briefcase, I wasn't really comfortable with the level of protection this case provided.I also didn't like the velcro closure, but then I'm not a big fan of velcro closures in general. All in all, I'm going to keep using the case that came with the visor as well to the protective plastic cover until I find something better."
1,The Truth about obama from facts about his upbringing!,The libtard element won't like this movie because it reveals the true background and upbringing of Barack Obama. The movie does not dispute obama's birth place nor does it call him a muslim or a communist. Rather from his own autobiography and from interviewing people from his past it sheds light on why he has made the choices he has. For those undecided or former followers of obama this movie will open up your eyes to the man who is potus.
1,Fun toy,I bought this for my 15 month-old daughter and she likes it a lot. My four year-old likes to play with her too! The only thing that I hate is the balls always go rolling and I have to crawl under my couches to get them! I think it would be more fun if I could buy more balls!
0,"Typical, boring, mainstream, etc.... no saviors of rock here","holy crap i listened to some of these songs on napster and i got a headache and almost went to sleep. Boring, boring, BORING! Even the ""heavy"" grunge tracks are boring. All the tracks are typical mainstream rock songs. Im sorta a fan of Rage, their alot more energetic and have more EXCITING guitar riffs. If you want real innovative, rock music check out PRIMUS (all hail les claypool, best bassist ever), Dream Theatre (cool prog rock), Red hot chili peppers (the masters of funk rock), Lostprophets (their kinda mainstream but at least you can listen to it without being bored), and for harder stuff definatley older metallica and for metal the swedish band In Flames (awesome guitars and singing) THIS IS CRAP"
0,Reality check indeed!!!!,"I dug this CD up and am listening to it right now. I put it away several months ago in distaste, writing it off as another overrated contrived piece of folky emo-trash. So I picked it up again after hearing and reading about the incessant praise given to this....album. Don't get me wrong, I love to sit around the house and mope to the stylings of Jeff Magnum or Nick Drake or even Sparklehorse, but this is just ridiculous. The music wraps itself effectively around daddy Oberst's warbly, ""Robert Smith"" (for lack of a better comparison) vocals, but do you seriously believe this 23 year old from Omaha is as tortured as his lyrics pronounce? Again, I like intense personal music (older Palace Music, for instance), but this just feels artificial to me, like the typical cry for attention. Blah! This was written as a warning for those who stumble upon this band and read nothing but rave reviews, and think, hey why shell out the 17 bucks if everyone seems to like it? Be forewarned."
1,Solid,"Any ankle holster is less comfortable than any belt holster. That said, this is the best and most comfortable ankle holster I've ever encountered. If you follow the instructions and break yourself into it it's easy to get used to. worn with low top shoes you either need really long pants or just be okay with it sticking out a little when you sit down, I've done it quite a bit and no one has noticed."
1,Sensible approach to marriage,"Few women are sensible as they breeze into marriage - I know I certainly wasn't, and am deeply grateful for having been fortunate enough to team up with a fanstastic man with whom I have been enjoying life for forty years. For there was a lot of luck involved. To thoroughly scrutinize our relationship prior to getting married would have felt like sacrilege. And yet all of the questions asked in the book are highly pertinent and deeply important, objective yet loving and understanding - and above all extremely helpful. A must read for all women at all ages, for different reasons. As a mother of three grown daughters, wish they had read it before getting married."
0,This book should be in the fiction file,"I have read twelve books about the Jackson family, including LaToya's, and from what I read this book is thirty percent true LaToya even said that her ex-husband (Jacks Gordan) wrote seven chapters of the book, and what the hell does he know about the Jacksons, so when I read this I had to read two other Jackson books so I could tell what is real and what isnt. so unless your a die hard Jackson fan I wouldnt recommend this."
1,It Could Happen to You,"The Unknown Prophets are an underground hip-hop collective from North Minneapolis. They've been hard at work creating quality hip-hop since 1997. The collective includes producer/emcee Big Jess, emcee Mad Son, and DJ Willie Lose. ""Now You Know"" is their third album. This album is pretty good. It covers important issues. Top songs include; Nitty Gritty (feat. Musab), All in My Head (phobia), My favorite It Could Happen to You, Da Da Da, and all the others. By the way this is better than Eminem, Dre and Bone Thugs-N-harmony. Please, support independent hip-hop."
0,due to packaging this product arrived folded,perhaps you could put your books into better packaging or at least put a piece of stiff cardboard in the package to prevent the book from moving in the packaging and folding--I realize it is an extra expense but it would at least assure that the books would arrive in better condition.
0,Wrong Disc,The CD that I received titled Film Music 2000 Vol 2 has the same title & jacket as on your website but a completely different list of songs.
1,"Great socks, worth the price",I have purchased these socks in the past. I most like the comfort factor and the quality. My husband likes the comfort they provide.Thorlo Unisex Thick Cushion Tennis Crew Sock
0,First disappointment by Nicholas Sparks,"I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired. I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time. The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had. I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines. Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John)!"
1,the best,"this is the best mattress pad i have gotten.it fits well , feal's well and i would buy it again. thank you."
1,Best Prey book,"Read all 21 of the Prey novels and this was the best.Very entertaining,good story. The first book Rules of Prey was great,but this was better."
1,Batman-Return to the Batcave,"Batman - Return to the BatcaveWas good to watch, remembered seeing in on TV. Liked how they showed how they met and what their lives were like back then. Was interesting, a bit campy, but interesting."
0,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY DVD MOVIE,"I am very worry up for my purchase, because almost 2 months ago I have purchased the DVD movie Black to you and it doesn't came, please send me the DVD movie ""Black"" or get my money back."
0,Loses signal very easily,"I bought this device so I can listen to music from my LG Chocolate on my home stereo wirelessly. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that the range tops out at about 15 feet. At greater distances, the device loses signal very easily, which requires a tedious pairing reset process.I also found that it loses signal if you try to do too much with the phone- for example scrolling through songs while one is already playing. It keeps the signal if I just setup a playlist and leave my phone near the device.On the plus side, it looks slick and is quite small. It integrates very nicely with my entertainment center."
0,Tip was blunt,"As delivered, it appears that the tip was flattened by an impact to a hard surface. The metal was mushed out. It was not usable."
0,total dissapointment,"This anticipated prequel left everyone begging for less. Less low brow Jar-Jar (better left on the cutting room floor in its entirety). The plot was threadbare, the characters two-dimentional, and the whole feel was lacking. Not worthy of the starwars name."
0,Beginner stuff,"This book is strictly for beginners, and it should say so in the title.Buy it if you need information about uses for a cable release, how bad you'll need a tripod, the differences between compact and SLR cameras, what a polarizing filter is for, how to change the white balance settings, and much more basic stuff, like always carry spare batteries and buy many memory cards now that they are cheap.Oh, the featured photos are quite good, but in that case treat yourself straight up with a big coffee table book."
0,Get a machine with separate frothing and brewing functions like the Capressa 302,having to froth at the precise moment the steam begins forming in the brewer is ridiculous. I have never gotten it right and it runs out of steam before the milk even gets warm. Nightmare from a company such as DeLonghi. I would have expected much more! I have a Capressa 302 and it lets you switch between brewing and frothing or neither so the machine can concentrate it's energy on the function at hand. So simple. This Delonghi gives you no options or control. It's either on or off and you better be ready with cup poised!
0,No Good!,"When you think of a mouse pad, you think of the word ""pad"". This is a piece of thin plastic with a design on it which didn't work wonders for me. Your better off using a old newspaper. Sure maybe most mice dont need a pad anymore but if you can stand the sound of your mouse scraping along this products surface then be my guest. Also, mine came damaged with a big marker point size dent in the middle. Was not impressed or even slightly satisfied. I advise the seller to be more clear in the description of this product. And I advise buyer to shop in person!"
0,Book missing 3 chapters,Chapters 22-27 were not in the book. It was missing pages 192-226. The book would be much better with all of the chapters.
1,great songs!,"great music, great lyric, easy listening. its a little slow and emo at some parts but good overall. especially for long car rides."
0,Battery life sucks but it does cut well....,"I hope this review will be helpful - contrary to several other reviews, the knife does actually cut very well. As I write this review, my husband is cutting thin slices of frozen beef off of a 3lb chunk of meat. However, the battery life is terrible. Even if you leave it in the charger right up until you use it, it always dies after about 5 mins of use. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he says it would be fine if it was corded. Go w/ a corded knife to eliminate power issues."
0,No Softboiled,"This product works great for hardboiled eggs but my soft boiled eggs are consistently undercooked. It also doesn't have a measure for even amounts of eggs on the measuring cup it comes with, just odd numbers of eggs. Otherwise it is a great product."
1,Variety of Good Articles,"I thought this was my Mom's magazine and never gave reading it a thought at all. Then the $5/year offer came so I decided to try it. My first issue was a pleasant surprise, full of tips and interesting articles and now I look forward to it's arrival every month."
0,bad bad bad too bad,"4 thumbs down, way down.this is a bad book, the writer tries to convince you with his statistics while he doesn't know statistics."
1,Good Book,This book is a classic and will help any couple or individual having sexual problems. I don't know about the seven weeks thing everybody's different.
1,"Been waiting a while, but it was worth it!","This is just another great sequel to a great game, the original, the best, C&C. It be just as great as the classic, but it will be more enjoyable to play!!!"
1,Helps to reduce heat buildup,Used this product in my RV. Not only does it help with frabric fading from the sunlight it also reduced the heat from the sun coming through the windows so the A/C does not have to work as hard.
1,Clifford was the favorite gift!,I gave Clifford to my nephew for his first birthday. During the party the other three three years olds and the one two year old all monopolized the toy never letting the one year old get a chance to use him! This toy was easy to put together and rides easily and smoothly. I am not convinced that it is the most durable toy (only time will tell) but it's first day the previously mentioned toddles took some down slope spills on Clifford and he stayed strong.Overall a great gift for a one year old who was just learning to walk and ride!
1,Rock 'n Roll comes to Iceland,"I saw this movie ca. 1995 in Oslo with Norwegian subtitles, the only Icelandic movie I know and a shame I haven't had the chance to see others. The movie depicts the relative wealth and attractiveness of American servicemen from Keflavik in the context of the extreme poverty of Icelanders living in an old quanset hut. The Icelanders can, of course, speak some English and the Americans can, also realistically, speak no Icelandic. Big, loud old American cars, rock and roll, and the desire to escape the crushing poverty. The film is memorable, and for another Icelandic viewpoint on the early drive toward globalization, read ""The Atom Station"" by Haldor Laxness.Icelandic is a beautiful language, essentially the Norwegian of a thousand years ago, the Viking era. I don't understand it but wish I did!"
1,Great Multi-Purpose Knife,"Since buying this knife a year ago, it has replaced my steel chef's knife as my standard go-to for the majority of cutting tasks in the kitchen. It has stayed consistently sharp throughout the year, with signs of chipping beginning to show up just now (I will send the knife to Kyocera for re-sharpening in a few months, although it still works perfectly well). I use it for chopping vegetables (carrots, celery, onions), trimming fat off meat, and cutting boneless meat. I cut on a bamboo cutting board. I revert to using my steel chef's knife for cutting bone-in meats and crushing garlic cloves. I have no problems with handling the knife; the lighter weight is something you barely notice after using it for a while. It is also extremely easy to clean, as most things do not stick to it the way they do to steel blades. Overall, I would highly recommend this knife!"
1,Very Pleased,My sons were very pleased with the purchase when it came in the mail. The condition of the disk was excellent.
0,It cannot be played at all,"We were so excited when the cd arrived, when we put it in it said not compatible in this area, how can we get a re[placement or our money back"
1,much less conspiracy theory than initial impression gives,"although this guy came out of what is largely held to be conspiracy theory, the points he draws upon are almost completely in line with modern sustainability and peak-oil studies, parts get really scary and you do think that perhaps he is exaggerating, however, when he says that he sees this happening over a 20-50 year period, and not overnight (like conspiracy theorists do), you start to get a really good sense of how rational this guy actually is, personally, i loved this documentary"
1,I Gotta Go is GREAT!,"I saw these I Gotta Go potty training reviews and had to go buy one for my son. I LOVE this DVD! The concept is great. I never thought children (and parents!) could have fun while potty training. There is no stress for my son or us.He does not want to wear diapers anymore. The songs are so cute, we all sing them.I am glad we bought the DVD, the tape would have been worn out by now! I recommend it to anyone I know who is potty training their children!"
0,Reformat,"Junk, absolute junk. Don't even try to complain to Creative. Talk about a bunch of losers. If you have a soundblaster already installed, you might as well reformat to get the new one to work. I am a computer engineer for crying out loud. The soundblaster uninstall does not work, and you can spend forever trying to track down all the files that need to be deleted so that your new card will install correctly, but you will never find them all.EDIT: I decided to up my review to 2 stars because my sound card has been working flawlessly since the install. However, If you have XP, and are replacing an existing Creative sound card with an Audigy, be prepared to reformat. I am one of two guys who sets up everybodys computers at work, install new hardware, software, etc. Everytime somebody has brought me a computer with XP and a creative soundcard already installed and wanted me to install an Audigy, I have had to reformat to get it to work."
0,bw/wm mystery,This was an excellent mystery and fine love story. Very interesting and very worth the cost and time.
0,I couldn't get through this movie...,I would just like to say what took the filmmaker hours to film (the fat butts) I see every single day. I could have shot that montage in under ten minutes.
0,A Major Disappointment,"Rarely have I been this disappointed in a book. It claims to be the history of Winchester which is certainly is not. What it is is page after page of very low quality black and white photos of Winchester firearms accompanied by a simplistic, broad brush description of each. Most of the text seems to have been lifted directly from one or more similar books which do a much better job than this piece of junk."
0,weak weak weak,"A note I sent to a friend:I forgot to tell you how mad I became as I got into the new book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ""borrowed"" from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 70% of Jordan's Wheel of Time series was published up to 4 years before Goodkind's Wizard's 1rst Rule. Anything good in Goodkind's book came from Jordan. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell ice cream, wanting another but having no more BlueBell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak..."
0,a shock to heavy metal,"This Album is awful it doesn't even have a single guitar solo james vocals were awful, I can't believe this who would've guessed that st. anger was going to turn out this bad (atleast in my opinion i don't know about you) The title track is just two verse and a chorus and they're singing the over & over for 7 min. and frantic was more than awful the rythm & drums are like dumping a trash, and kirk should've played some solos it might have made the album a little bit better, the problem is that metallica made this album not for the music but to sell the album, so in my point of view this album doesn't even deservea star & its disgrace to heavy metal."
0,Mile Deep in Your Ear,"I suppose that the sound and noise-canceling quality of these are okay. However, they are so deep that they were painful to put into my ear for any extended period of time. I might as well have shoved a Q-tip down to my ear drum. I would avoid these if comfort is a concern when choosing ear bud style noise-canceling headphones."
1,"My dogs love it, but it gets dirty fast.....","My 4 small dogs really love this, but it gets dirty fast. I dont think the filters are that great. I have to clean it every couple of days. Sediment collects around the pump and in every corner. You really need to scrub it to get clean. It does hold a lot of water, but I have to fill it up everyday too. I think my dogs are drinking more water since I got it. As soon as I put it down with fresh water, they all come rushing over to drink. That makes me happy."
1,A valuable resource ...,"A valuable resource for teachers of English, or a handy supplement for learners, ""Vocab-ability"" offers a way to get to the root of words. Teachers will find this to be a means to enhance their teaching methods by using simple terms to explain more complex vocabulary. Entries are given in a clear, concise form, grouped according to stems, prefixes, suffixes and numbers. The index is useful in that it lists the meanings of roots, allowing students to take a word they know, say ""thin,"" and come up with ""tenuous""or ""attenuate"" (root ""tenu""). In all, it represents a no-nonsense way to gain word power.-- Don Dotto, JSelect Magazine"
1,Worked like a charm...,It was finally time to permanently mount our Huffy basketball hoop and get rid of the water-weighted plastic base. I bought this kit and was able to anchor the unit into the ground in concrete. It was nice to know that Huffy had a way to convert the plastic-base version into an in-ground version. Protected my investment and worked like a charm!!!
1,Fluffy White Rice In 60 Seconds,"My family tends to eat in ""shifts"", and we eat a lot of rice. If I cook a pot of rice, it takes 30 minutes, and is cold and sticky by the time my family gets to it. Now, my boys can have their rice when they want it. Viva La Rice works great for lunch, too. We really like this product!"
1,"Less than $20, Perfect 10","I just want to say that I was going to get the ENO hammock and shell out $50 for the name. I am so glad I did not! This thing is great, packs down tiny, you could throw this in any day pack and boom you have a place to chill and relax. I just got back from San Juan and my wife and I used this on the beach in the palm trees. You cannot beat this price and the construction is top notch...buy this hammock!"
0,Not their best.,"I have all 5 Da Buzz albums. This one is not my favorite. It has a couple of great songs on it, but that's it. Get the other four albums, they are full of wonderfull songs."
0,The unit was defective,"The unit did not turn on when connected to the car lighter. After checking on different cars, I concluded that the unit was defective.I returned it and received a new one in a short time.The new one worked fine. In general, the sound is good, although I am able to hear some noise (little) when there is a gap between songs."
1,Excellent Wine Opener,"This is one of the best wine openers I've ever used, including the larger table tops. I like the foil cutter - makes the bottle nice and neat - and the cork removal is nearly effortless. I am very pleased with this purchase and will purchase another as a gift."
1,Best Wardrobe Cleanup Book I've Read!,"I've been in the ""image"" business for many years and this is the best book I've read (studied) for wardrobe cleanup and filling in the basics. I applied the steps involved and am absolutely thrilled with the results. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a will to work at looking good."
0,A Far Cry From Todd's Best,"This album is a far cry from Something Anything, A Wizard A True Star, etc. Something Anything, Hermit and Tortured Artist were all great records where Todd played all the instruments, sang all the vocals and wrote all the songs. This record is just weak to mediocre at best. The songs are weak. The drums and keyboards sound like a cheap Casio keyboard. I can't recall one chorus. Because I know and love the great music that has come from Todd Rundgren throughout his career, I can't give this effort anything more than 1 star."
1,I love this Bible!,"I wouldn't take it to church because its in chronological order and you might have a hard time finding a Scripture to look up, but for just reading like a novel, this is the easiest to understand. It helps me make more sense out of the Word of God and understand what was going on."
1,Wonderful Mix of Classic songs,As always the Chieftains do not disappoint with this collection classical blue grass and Irish standards.Is moving and touching at the same time
1,awsome,this is such a great movie. i own it on vhs and now am getting 2 more shadow raider movies on dvd. when i was really little i got this movie. when i watched it it was one of my favorite movies ( it still is).there is nothing bad about this engoyable movie!
